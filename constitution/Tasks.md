# Engineering Execution Plan

## 0. Version History & Changelog

- v0.12.1 - Hardened the TypeScript provider and framework compatibility boundary by promoting fail-closed provider bridge checks, renaming the advertised provider capabilities to the narrower framework-mediated labels, and refreshing compatibility evidence so green TypeScript reports no longer imply unsupported native provider behavior.
- v0.12.0 - Opened TypeScript Kernel Gap Closure with Epic Z syscall implementation planning, Epic AA kernel conformance promotion, and Epic AB contract-first run-liveness recovery.
- v0.11.1 - Closed Epic Y final conformance closure: KRT-Y014..KRT-Y023 now land one shared semantic conformance runner, JSON-RPC adapter manifests, TypeScript and Rust adapter hosts, executable capability selection, trace-plan lifecycle checks, guardrails, meta-conformance, and refreshed shared-runner compatibility evidence.
- v0.11.0 - Reopened Epic Y final conformance closure: KRT-Y013 records the posture correction, and KRT-Y014..KRT-Y023 form the active critical path to extract one shared semantic conformance engine, convert implementation language runners into adapter hosts, enforce executable capability selection, and add meta-conformance plus trace-plan support.

## 1. Executive Summary & Active Critical Path

- **Total Active Story Points:** 59
- **Critical Path:** KRT-Z001 -> KRT-Z002 -> KRT-Z003 -> KRT-Z004 -> KRT-Z005 -> KRT-AA001 -> KRT-AA002 -> KRT-AA003 -> KRT-AA004 -> KRT-AB001 -> KRT-AB002 -> KRT-AB003 -> KRT-AB004.
- **Planning Assumptions:** Epics A-Y are closed in current repo reality. Authority Packet manifests follow TechSpec §4.11; Conformance Plans follow §4.12; the revised Implementation Adapter Protocol follows §4.13. The active TypeScript kernel line is documentation-backed by `docs/KrakenKernelSpecification.md` and TechSpec §3.2, §4.2, §4.3, §4.11-§4.13, and §5.4. Rust implementation work is out of scope unless explicitly named by capability evidence.

### Brownfield Continuity Note

- The current codebase already contains the workspace scaffold, shared core types, kernel protocol package, memory backend, SQLite backend, kernel testkit, shared framework contract packages, provider contract package, `runtime-core`, and the ReAct Driver foundation package.
- Current repository reality includes closed Epic K, L, M, N, O, and P behavior with explicit closure artifacts in `constitution/spikes/epic-k-react-loop-cancellation-inventory.md`, `constitution/spikes/epic-l-parity-inventory.md`, `constitution/spikes/epic-m-tool-approval-gap-inventory.md`, `constitution/spikes/epic-n-ai-sdk-bridge-inventory.md`, `constitution/spikes/epic-o-stream-adapter-inventory.md`, and `constitution/spikes/epic-p-playground-host-inventory.md`.
- `KRT-Q001` is now closed in current repo reality through `constitution/spikes/epic-q-hardening-gap-inventory.md`, which inventories the extraction targets, release-check targets, portability matrix, deferred Deno work, and remaining hardening gaps for the rest of Epic Q.
- The Epic Q target packages now live under `boundaries/framework/implementations/typescript/testkit` and `boundaries/providers/implementations/typescript/testkit`, with release and verification scripts under `tools/scripts`.
- The private playground host now also owns automated aimock E2E validation lanes that exercise `@tuvren/provider-bridge-ai-sdk` through local OpenAI-, Anthropic-, and Gemini-compatible HTTP mock provider boundaries without provider credentials, covering streamed text, structured output, tool continuation, approval pause/resume, provider metadata, cancellation, provider failure, malformed responses, and unmatched fixtures.
- The private playground host now also exposes an opt-in `host-playground:scenario-gemini` lane that exercises the same bridge through `@ai-sdk/google@3.0.64` and real Gemini credentials for streaming, metadata, structured output, multi-step streamed tool continuity, and approval resume behavior without moving live-provider cost and flake into default verification.
- Those Epic Q testkit packages are now helper/facade packages; compatibility evidence flows through implementation-scoped TypeScript conformance runners over shared boundary-owned assets.
- Planning verification confirmed `ai@6.0.142` and `@ai-sdk/provider@3.0.8` are available and that `@ai-sdk/provider@3.0.8` exports `LanguageModelV3`, `ProviderV3`, `LanguageModelV3CallOptions`, `LanguageModelV3GenerateResult`, and `LanguageModelV3StreamPart`.
- Current TypeScript provider and framework compatibility evidence now records the mediated capability subset explicitly: framework-owned tool execution, framework-owned approval boundary, and rejection of undeclared native strict structured output. Shared provider and framework plans now prove those negative paths directly instead of relying on broad capability labels that could overstate native provider support.
- Epic N now extends repo reality beyond those planning notes: the bridge package exists and the closure artifact above is the authoritative upstream seam for Epic O.
- Epic O now extends repo reality beyond those planning notes: `@tuvren/stream-core`, `@tuvren/stream-sse`, and `@tuvren/stream-agui` exist, `constitution/spikes/epic-o-stream-adapter-inventory.md` is the authoritative adapter mapping record, and Epic P must treat tee-based fanout plus the documented `tuvren.runtime.*` AG-UI custom namespace as the handoff surface rather than rediscovering protocol gaps or resubscription hazards.
- Epic P now extends repo reality beyond those planning notes: `@tuvren/playground-host` exists under `boundaries/hosts/implementations/typescript/playground`, `constitution/spikes/epic-p-playground-host-inventory.md` is the authoritative playground handoff, full-turn streams cover canonical/SSE/AG-UI fanout, approval resume continuation is projected to canonical/SSE only, non-reload memory scenarios run under Bun tests, branching is validated from a completed source head, and SQLite reload is validated through the built Node CLI path.
- Epic R now extends repo reality beyond those planning notes: the repository has the explicit multi-language transition guide plus the closure inventory in `constitution/spikes/epic-r-multilanguage-transition-foundation-inventory.md`, Epic S has since closed the artifact promotion line, Epic T has since closed the kernel interop governance line, Epic U has since closed the Rust kernel baseline line, and Epic V has since closed the TypeScript framework to Rust kernel interop stabilization line.

### Sequential Scope Rule

- Epic V is closed. Epic W starts from the measured compatibility evidence and the Epic V closure inventories, but it is not Rust framework work. Epic W must mature the semantic ecosystem itself: coverage matrix, assertion-bearing conformance suites, promoted TypeScript-local semantics, and compatibility evidence precise enough for future implementations to consume without treating TypeScript as the oracle.
- Epic W and Epic X are closed. Epic X completed the structural normalization that relocated TS-only assets out of language-neutral boundary slots without changing semantics, conformance suites, fixtures, public package APIs, or generated artifacts.
- Epic Y authority-packet closure and final conformance closure are closed. The promoted neutral surfaces (`runtime-api`, `driver-api`, `event-stream`, `core-types`) plus the ReAct-driver, kernel protocol, and provider bridge plan families now resolve cross-implementation authority through packets, plans, generated artifacts, guardrails, shared-runner evidence, and implementation adapter hosts.

### Planning Heuristic

- Prefer epic slices that look likely to land comfortably below roughly `5,000` lines of new code and treat roughly `10,000` lines as a warning threshold.
- This is a scoping heuristic for planning clarity, not an execution cap or a substitute for code review judgment.

## 2. Project Phasing & Iteration Strategy

### Delivery Cadence Posture

- No sprint or release-train cadence is assumed in this plan.
- This section uses "iteration strategy" only because the planning framework requires that heading; the content below is dependency phasing and scope partitioning, not a commitment to Scrum-style iterations.

### Current Active Scope

- Epic Z is active to add the missing boundary-owned TypeScript `RuntimeKernel` implementation package over the existing backend contract and close the documented syscall semantics that currently live only in private playground logic or protocol types.
- Epic AA is active after Epic Z to promote kernel syscall, logical, and observe behavior into authority-packet-backed conformance plans and shared-runner evidence.
- Epic AB has landed in current repo reality as a contract-first liveness extension for leased running ownership and stale-run preemption, with shared framework stale-recovery conformance now promoted alongside kernel extension evidence; Rust remains non-applicable unless it advertises the relevant liveness capability.

### Future / Deferred Scope

- Rust framework product implementation work is deferred beyond Epic Y. Rust framework adapter-host work is active only to prove that the shared runner reports honest red/green evidence from native implementation behavior.
- Rust kernel gap closure for the new TypeScript-first syscall/liveness epics is deferred unless a later Tasks revision explicitly adds Rust tickets. Rust lanes may report pass, fail, or non-applicable evidence based only on advertised capability.
- `LanguageModelV2` / `ProviderV2` compatibility is deferred.
- AI SDK agent loops, AI SDK UI message protocols, AI SDK transport helpers, LangChain bridges, provider-native tool support, and first-class Tuvren provider packages are deferred.
- ACP or any additional host protocol beyond SSE and AG-UI is deferred until a future TechSpec revision names it.
- Future concrete drivers beyond ReAct, official peer backends beyond memory/SQLite, and future product implementation lines beyond the current TypeScript/Rust lanes and active TypeScript kernel closure line are deferred unless a later TechSpec revision activates them from the matured semantic evidence, authority packets, and shared runner evidence.
- FFI-based Rust embedding is deferred until after the process-boundary kernel seam is proven boring and durable.
- Deno portability checks are deferred until public package surfaces stabilize enough to avoid testing scaffolding churn.
- Authoring authority packets for surfaces beyond the five named in Epic Y (kernel protocol packet hardening, host stream adapter packets, telemetry semconv packet, compatibility-ledger packet, AI SDK bridge packet) is deferred to a later epic that may build on Epic Y mechanics.

### Archived or Already Completed Scope

- Epics A-J established the architecture-first monorepo, shared core types, kernel protocol, memory and SQLite backends, shared framework contracts, `runtime-core`, the first ReAct driver slice, and the runtime-foundation hardening line.
- Epics K-M closed the first production-depth ReAct loop, streaming/provider parity, and tool/approval integration; authoritative closure evidence lives in `constitution/spikes/epic-k-react-loop-cancellation-inventory.md`, `constitution/spikes/epic-l-parity-inventory.md`, and `constitution/spikes/epic-m-tool-approval-gap-inventory.md`.
- Epics N-Q closed the post-ReAct TypeScript expansion line for the AI SDK bridge, host stream adapters, playground host harness, and release/portability hardening; authoritative closure evidence lives in `constitution/spikes/epic-n-ai-sdk-bridge-inventory.md`, `constitution/spikes/epic-o-stream-adapter-inventory.md`, `constitution/spikes/epic-p-playground-host-inventory.md`, and `constitution/spikes/epic-q-release-hardening-inventory.md`. That closure line now includes automated aimock provider-boundary coverage across OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini plus an opt-in real Gemini playground lane without reactivating the closed Epic Q backlog.
- Epic R closed the multi-language transition foundation through `constitution/spikes/epic-r-multilanguage-transition-guide.md` and `constitution/spikes/epic-r-multilanguage-transition-foundation-inventory.md`, delivering boundary-owned conformance and contract scaffold, canonical target vocabulary, telemetry codegen authority, and the first measured TypeScript-only compatibility baseline.
- Epic S closed boundary contract and conformance artifactization through `constitution/spikes/epic-s-boundary-contract-conformance-artifactization-inventory.md`, delivering TypeSpec-authored tool/provider artifacts, kernel CDDL grammar, implementation-scoped TypeScript conformance runners, and compatibility evidence sourced from those runners.
- Epic T closed kernel interop governance through `constitution/spikes/epic-t-kernel-interop-surface-inventory.md` and `constitution/spikes/epic-t-kernel-interop-governance-inventory.md`, delivering the governed kernel-only proto authority and Buf-backed interop governance lane.
- Epic U closed the Rust kernel baseline through `constitution/spikes/epic-u-rust-kernel-baseline-inventory.md`, delivering the root Cargo workspace, Rust kernel core, Rust conformance runner, runnable Rust gRPC service, and Rust telemetry helper without adding a TypeScript transport client or Rust framework path.
- Epic V closed TypeScript framework to Rust kernel interop stabilization through `constitution/spikes/epic-v-transport-decision-inventory.md` and `constitution/spikes/epic-v-framework-rust-kernel-interop-closure-inventory.md`, delivering the TypeScript gRPC transport helper, runtime selection seam, real interop-smoke evidence, compatibility-ledger interop entries, and separated cross-language verification.
- Rust framework start is no longer Epic W. It is deferred behind Epic W's semantic maturity evidence.

## 4. Ticket List

### Epic R - Multilanguage Transition Foundation (MTF)

- Epic R is closed in current repo reality.
- Closure artifacts:
  - `constitution/spikes/epic-r-multilanguage-transition-guide.md`
  - `constitution/spikes/epic-r-multilanguage-transition-foundation-inventory.md`
- Durable outcome:
  - the constitution now records the authority stack, target repo shape, migration phases, and Rust-kernel-first transition rule
  - the repo now contains boundary-owned conformance roots, future contract-authority homes, the kernel interop home, canonical `lint` / `conformance` / `codegen` targets, a formal telemetry semantic-convention source plus generated outputs, and a measured TypeScript-only compatibility baseline
  - the TypeScript testkits remain helper/facade packages over language-agnostic assets rather than compatibility-evidence authority
  - Epic S has closed the artifact promotion work that follows this foundation

**KRT-R001 Multilanguage Transition Guide**

- **Type:** Spike
- **Effort:** 2
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Q006
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `1.2`, `2`, `4.5`; TechSpec `1.1`, `3.6`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Formalize the multi-language transition guide into the constitution so the next implementation line begins from explicit repo-owned authority instead of ad hoc portability assumptions.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given Epic Q is closed in current repo reality
When the multilanguage transition guide is formalized
Then the constitution records the authority stack, target repo shape, migration phases, immediate guardrails, and the Tasks and TechSpec status language for the next implementation line
```

**KRT-R002 Boundary-Owned Transition Scaffolding**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-R001
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2`, `5`; TechSpec `3.6`, `5.1`, `5.1.1`
- **Description:** Add the first substantial boundary-owned `conformance/`, `interop/`, `telemetry/`, and `reports/compatibility/` scaffolding needed by the transition line while preserving current TypeScript package behavior.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the transition guide is the new planning handoff
When boundary-owned transition scaffolding is added
Then the owning boundaries and repo root have the planned artifact homes for conformance, interop, telemetry, and compatibility reporting
And the new structure creates a meaningful early slice of the target repo shape rather than only placeholder stubs
And the existing TypeScript implementation path still builds and tests without semantic rewrites
```

**KRT-R003 Canonical Target Vocabulary and Tool Wrappers**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-R002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `2.1`, `5`; TechSpec `1.1`, `5.1.1`, `5.2`
- **Description:** Define the canonical repo-wide target vocabulary and wire Nx/tool wrappers so `build`, `test`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `conformance`, `codegen`, and `interop-smoke` delegate to the native toolchain for each active ecosystem.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the transition scaffolding exists
When canonical targets and wrappers are introduced
Then relevant projects expose the shared target vocabulary
And each target delegates to Bun, Cargo, Buf, or another native tool rather than replacing it with TypeScript-specific orchestration logic
```

**KRT-R004 Telemetry Semantic-Convention Source and Compatibility Contract**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 2
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-R003
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `4.5`, `5`; TechSpec `3.6`, `4.10`, `5.2`
- **Description:** Add the formal telemetry semantic-convention source plus the compatibility-ledger contract so later cross-language work has a stable evidence surface before Rust code lands.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the transition foundation is active
When the telemetry semantic-convention source and compatibility contract are added
Then the repository contains an authored OpenTelemetry semantic-convention source plus reviewed compatibility-ledger shape definitions
And the telemetry source is ready to drive generated TypeScript and Rust constants or helpers for current and future implementation lines
And no hand-authored pass or fail claims are recorded in place of measured suite evidence
```

### Epic S - Boundary Contract and Conformance Artifactization (BCA)

- Closed in current repo reality. Closure evidence lives in `constitution/spikes/epic-s-boundary-contract-conformance-artifactization-inventory.md`.

**KRT-S001 Contract Promotion Inventory**

- **Type:** Spike
- **Effort:** 2
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-R003
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`; TechSpec `3.6`, `4.8`, `5.1`
- **Description:** Inventory which framework and provider contract packages should promote TypeSpec now, which should remain unchanged for now, and how current testkit responsibilities map onto future boundary-owned conformance assets.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the transition scaffolding and target vocabulary exist
When the contract promotion inventory is completed
Then the repository records which contract packages adopt TypeSpec now, which stay unchanged, which artifacts each emits, and how current testkit responsibilities map into future conformance ownership
```

**KRT-S002 Framework and Provider TypeSpec Promotion**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-S001
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-019`, `CAP-P0-020`, `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `2`, `5`; TechSpec `3.6`, `4.8`, `5.2`
- **Description:** Promote the selected framework and provider contract packages to authored TypeSpec sources and emit reviewed JSON Schema/OpenAPI artifacts without changing the shared semantic meaning of their public contracts.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the promotion inventory names the first contract packages
When TypeSpec promotion is complete
Then each selected contract package contains boundary-owned TypeSpec sources and emitted JSON Schema and OpenAPI artifacts
And the public contract meaning stays aligned with the existing runtime semantics and docs
```

**KRT-S003 Kernel CDDL Grammar**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-S001
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-001`, `CAP-P0-004`, `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`; TechSpec `3.1`, `3.6`, `4.8`
- **Description:** Add CDDL-authored kernel record grammar for the canonical protocol records, manifests, runs, and recovery-shaped payloads without treating grammar as semantic authority over behavior.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the transition inventory has named the kernel artifact work
When kernel CDDL grammar is added
Then canonical kernel record families are represented under boundary-owned CDDL
And the grammar aligns with current protocol shapes without redefining recovery or lineage semantics in place of the docs
```

**KRT-S004 Conformance Asset Split and TypeScript Runners**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-S002, KRT-S003
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-005`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`; TechSpec `3.6`, `4.8`, `5.2`
- **Description:** Split the current TypeScript-first testkit responsibilities into boundary-owned conformance schemas, fixtures, and scenarios plus TypeScript-specific runners that consume those suites as one peer implementation path among many.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given contract packages and kernel grammar have authored machine-readable sources
When the conformance split is complete
Then the owning boundaries contain shared conformance schemas, fixtures, and scenarios
And the TypeScript implementation runs those suites through implementation-specific runners instead of treating testkit helpers as the semantic authority
And the resulting structure makes TypeScript one peer consumer of the shared behavioral corpus rather than the root implementation authority
```

### Epic T - Kernel Interop Governance (KIG)

- Closed in current repo reality.
- Closure artifacts:
  - `constitution/spikes/epic-t-kernel-interop-surface-inventory.md`
  - `constitution/spikes/epic-t-kernel-interop-governance-inventory.md`
- Durable outcome:
  - the repo now contains kernel-only proto authority under `boundaries/kernel/interop/grpc/proto/`
  - root Buf v2 lint, generation, and `FILE` breaking governance are in place
  - Devenv declares the native Buf and Protobuf-ES generator tooling
  - generated bindings are placed under the consuming framework implementation tree and ignored by source control
  - `kernel-interop-grpc` exposes `codegen` and `interop-smoke` lanes without claiming real Rust interop evidence early

**KRT-T001 Kernel Interop Surface Inventory**

- **Type:** Spike
- **Effort:** 2
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-S004
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`; TechSpec `4.9`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Inventory the narrow kernel-only interop surface, transport non-goals, versioning posture, and event/error envelope boundaries before authoring `.proto` files, including the existing thread/branch/head operations the framework must preserve over a remote kernel path.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given boundary-owned conformance assets now exist
When the kernel interop surface inventory is completed
Then the repository records the kernel operations, event and error envelopes, transport non-goals, and the rule that the initial interop seam is narrower than the full framework API
And the inventory explicitly includes the thread, branch, turn, and run lifecycle operations needed to preserve the current runtime surface over a remote kernel path
And the inventory explicitly excludes framework-owned ExecutionHandle controls such as cancel, steer, and approval resolution from the kernel transport
```

**KRT-T002 Proto and Buf Governance**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-T001
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2`, `5`; TechSpec `4.9`, `5.2`
- **Description:** Add kernel `.proto` ownership plus root Buf v2 configuration so the first transport surface has lint, generation, and breaking-change governance from the start without widening into framework handle controls.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the kernel interop surface has been inventoried
When proto and Buf governance is added
Then the repository contains boundary-owned kernel `.proto` files plus root Buf configuration
And transport changes are gated by lint and breaking-change checks rather than ad hoc review alone
And Buf `FILE` compatibility is the default breaking gate from the first `.proto` merge onward
```

**KRT-T003 Interop-Smoke Target Wiring and Binding Placement**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-R003, KRT-T002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2.1`, `4.5`; TechSpec `4.9`, `5.1.1`, `5.2`
- **Description:** Wire `codegen` and `interop-smoke` targets plus generated-binding placement rules so transport support code stays with the consuming implementation tree and the repo can exercise real cross-process checks later.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the kernel `.proto` surface is Buf-governed
When interop-smoke target wiring is complete
Then generated bindings live under the consuming implementation tree
And the repo exposes `codegen` and `interop-smoke` targets that invoke the native generators and smoke paths for the active ecosystems
```

### Epic U - Rust Kernel Baseline (RKB)

- Closed in current repo reality through `constitution/spikes/epic-u-rust-kernel-baseline-inventory.md`. This epic introduced Rust only under the kernel boundary and only after the artifact-backed seam existed.

**KRT-U001 Cargo Workspace and Rust Toolchain Integration**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 3
- **Dependencies:** KRT-T002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `2`, `5`; TechSpec `1`, `5.1`, `5.2`
- **Description:** Introduce the root Cargo workspace and Rust toolchain files plus repo wrappers so Rust tasks join the monorepo without redefining boundary ownership or replacing Nx orchestration.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the kernel transport surface is governed
When Rust workspace integration is added
Then the repository contains the root Cargo workspace and toolchain files
And repo orchestration can invoke Rust-native build and test flows without redefining the boundary-owned layout
```

**KRT-U002 Rust Kernel Core Scaffold**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Dependencies:** KRT-R004, KRT-S003, KRT-U001
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-001`, `CAP-P0-005`, `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`; TechSpec `3.1`, `3.6`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Implement the first Rust kernel core scaffold against the shared protocol profile, deterministic identity rules, and kernel-visible operations without widening semantics or transport scope.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the Rust workspace exists and kernel grammar is authored
When the Rust kernel core scaffold is complete
Then Rust implements the required protocol record and validation baselines for the first conformance phase
And the Rust kernel does not widen the shared semantics or depend on framework-specific shortcuts
And Rust implementation work consumes the preexisting telemetry semantic-convention source instead of inventing a second observability vocabulary
```

**KRT-U003 Rust Conformance Runner**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Dependencies:** KRT-S004, KRT-U002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-005`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `4.5`; TechSpec `3.6`, `5.2`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Add a Rust conformance runner that consumes the shared boundary-owned protocol and recovery suites using the same suite naming and reporting discipline as TypeScript.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the Rust kernel core and shared conformance assets exist
When the Rust conformance runner is added
Then the protocol and recovery suites run against Rust through the shared suite contract
And the reported results are comparable with the TypeScript runner outputs without bespoke interpretation
```

**KRT-U004 Rust gRPC Kernel Service**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Dependencies:** KRT-T002, KRT-U002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`; TechSpec `4.9`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Expose the Rust kernel over the governed transport contract as the first real cross-process runtime seam.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the Rust kernel core and governed transport surface exist
When the Rust gRPC kernel service is implemented
Then the kernel operations and stable event and error payloads are available over the defined process boundary
And the service remains limited to the kernel scope rather than reimplementing the framework surface
```

### Epic V - TypeScript Framework and Rust Kernel Interop Stabilization (TRI)

- Closed in current repo reality through `constitution/spikes/epic-v-transport-decision-inventory.md` and `constitution/spikes/epic-v-framework-rust-kernel-interop-closure-inventory.md`. This epic proved the boring day-two TS-framework-to-Rust-kernel path; Epic W now uses that evidence as input to mature the semantic ecosystem before any additional implementation line starts.

**KRT-V001 TypeScript Transport Client and Runtime Switch**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-U004
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-019`, `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `2.1`, `4.5`; TechSpec `4.1`, `4.9`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Add the TypeScript-side transport client and explicit runtime selection seam so the framework can target either the in-process TypeScript kernel or the Rust kernel service without changing host-facing semantics.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the Rust kernel service exists
When the TypeScript transport client and runtime switch are added
Then the framework can target either the local TypeScript kernel or the Rust kernel through an explicit seam
And host-facing runtime behavior stays aligned with the existing public contracts
```

**KRT-V002 Cross-Language Interop and Compatibility Matrix**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-U003, KRT-V001
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `4.5`; TechSpec `4.10`, `5.2`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Run real TS framework to Rust kernel scenarios and generate the compatibility matrix from the resulting conformance and interop-smoke evidence as a conservative near-public readiness signal.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the Rust kernel passes its conformance runner and the TypeScript framework can target the transport seam
When cross-language interop scenarios run
Then named TS framework to Rust kernel smoke suites pass or fail explicitly
And the repository generates a compatibility matrix that records implementation ids, suite ids, suite versions, statuses, and evidence paths from those measured results
And the resulting report is worded conservatively enough to function as a near-public readiness signal rather than an internal-only scratch artifact
```

**KRT-V003 Telemetry Conventions and CI Lane Separation**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-R004, KRT-V002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `5`; TechSpec `3.6`, `4.10`, `5.2`
- **Description:** Apply the shared telemetry vocabulary across TypeScript and Rust interop paths and separate CI into repo-global, language-native, and cross-language validation lanes.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given cross-language interop scenarios now exist
When telemetry conventions and CI lane separation are implemented
Then TypeScript and Rust interop traces and reports use the shared runtime attribute vocabulary
And both implementation lines consume helpers or constants derived from the preexisting telemetry semantic-convention source
And CI clearly separates repo-global checks, language-native checks, and cross-language parity checks
```

**KRT-V004 Interop Closure Inventory**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 2
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-V003
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `5`, `6`; TechSpec `4.10`, `5.3`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Record parity status, residual gaps, and the readiness gate for future semantic maturity work in a closure inventory and update the planning artifacts for the next revision.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the TS framework to Rust kernel seam has conformance, interop, telemetry, and compatibility evidence
When the interop closure inventory is recorded
Then the repository documents measured parity status, remaining gaps, semantic maturity prerequisites, and the TechSpec and Tasks status updates for the next planning pass
```

### Epic W - Semantic Ecosystem Maturity (SEM)

- Closed in current repo reality through `constitution/spikes/epic-w-semantic-coverage-matrix.md` and `constitution/spikes/epic-w-semantic-ecosystem-maturity-closure-inventory.md`.
- Epic W is not Rust framework work. Rust framework start, future concrete drivers, new official backends, provider expansion, host protocol expansion, and future language lines remain deferred unless a later TechSpec revision activates them from Epic W evidence.

**KRT-W001 Semantic Coverage Matrix and Gap Inventory**

- **Type:** Spike
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-V004
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`, `5`; TechSpec `2 ADR-021`, `3.6`, `4.8`, `5.4`
- **Description:** Inventory the semantic coverage gap between `docs/`, TypeScript implementation tests, boundary-owned conformance suites, implementation runners, and compatibility evidence.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given Epics A through V are closed in current repo reality
When the semantic coverage matrix is created
Then each high-value kernel, framework, driver, provider, stream, backend, and error semantic area is mapped to its human spec section, current implementation tests, boundary-owned conformance coverage, compatibility evidence, and gap status
And every gap is classified as promote-to-conformance, implementation-specific, deferred-with-rationale, obsolete, or requiring upstream clarification
And no future implementation line is treated as authorized by object existence or smoke success alone
```

**KRT-W002 Assertion-Bearing Conformance Suite Contract**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-W001
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `4.5`, `5`; TechSpec `3.6`, `4.8`, `4.10`
- **Description:** Mature conformance suite manifests so they name semantic checks, required assertions, runner applicability, evidence fields, and suite-version policy instead of only listing fixture files.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the coverage matrix identifies semantics that must be shared across implementations
When the conformance suite contract is updated
Then boundary-owned suite manifests can declare named semantic checks, fixtures or scenarios, required assertions, implementation applicability, and expected evidence fields
And compatibility reporting can distinguish a check-level pass from a command-level smoke success
And existing TypeScript and Rust conformance runners remain compatible or are migrated in the same change
```

**KRT-W003 Kernel Semantic Conformance Promotion**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-W002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-001`, `CAP-P0-004`, `CAP-P0-005`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`; TechSpec `3.1`, `3.2`, `3.6`, `4.8`
- **Description:** Promote kernel lifecycle, lineage, recovery, stable error, invalid transition, staged-result, and branch-head semantics from implementation-local tests into boundary-owned kernel conformance suites with TypeScript and Rust runner evidence where applicable.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given kernel semantics are currently split between boundary fixtures and implementation-local tests
When kernel semantic conformance promotion is complete
Then the kernel boundary owns assertion-bearing suites for durable identity, lifecycle transitions, lineage validation, recovery state, branch-head movement, staged-result invariants, and stable error codes
And TypeScript and Rust kernel runners publish comparable evidence for every applicable kernel check
And any kernel behavior not promoted is explicitly classified in the semantic coverage matrix
```

**KRT-W004 Framework and Driver Semantic Conformance Promotion**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-W002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-019`, `CAP-P0-020`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2.1`, `4.5`; TechSpec `4.1`, `4.2`, `4.3`, `4.8`
- **Description:** Promote framework and initial ReAct-driver semantics for turn lifecycle, stream reconciliation, approval pause/resume/reject/cancel, steering, branching, manifests, hook outcomes, tool execution ordering, and stable runtime errors into boundary-owned conformance suites.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the TypeScript runtime-core tests currently carry rich framework and driver semantics
When framework and driver semantic conformance promotion is complete
Then boundary-owned suites assert the shared semantics required for future framework or driver implementations
And TypeScript runtime evidence proves those suites against the existing implementation without making runtime-core the semantic oracle
And ReAct-specific checks are separated from driver-neutral framework checks
```

**KRT-W005 Provider and Stream Semantic Conformance Promotion**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-W002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-020`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2.1`, `4.5`, `5`; TechSpec `4.5`, `4.6`, `4.7`, `4.8`
- **Description:** Promote provider bridge, provider contract, canonical stream, SSE, AG-UI, metadata continuity, structured output, tool continuation, and provider-failure semantics into boundary-owned provider/framework conformance where those semantics are not implementation-specific.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given provider and stream semantics are currently split across contract tests, playground tests, and adapter tests
When provider and stream semantic conformance promotion is complete
Then boundary-owned suites assert the provider-neutral prompt, response, stream chunk, tool, structured output, metadata, error, and adapter projection semantics required by future implementations
And provider-family-specific or host-specific behavior remains documented as implementation-specific or local validation
And compatibility evidence records the promoted provider and stream checks separately from playground-only smoke coverage
```

**KRT-W006 Compatibility Evidence Hardening and Closure Inventory**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 2
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-W003, KRT-W004, KRT-W005
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `5`, `6`; TechSpec `4.10`, `5.3`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Harden compatibility evidence so suite results cite named checks and record the remaining gates for future implementation-line activation.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the promoted conformance suites now emit assertion-level evidence
When compatibility evidence hardening is complete
Then the compatibility matrix records suite ids, versions, implementation ids, check summaries, statuses, and evidence paths from measured runs
And the Epic W closure inventory records which semantic surfaces are mature, which remain deferred, and what a later TechSpec must cite before authorizing Rust framework or other new implementation work
And no public or planning claim implies that a new implementation can start without satisfying the named semantic maturity gates
```

### Epic X - TypeScript Topology Normalization (TTN)

- Closed in current repo reality. Planning artifact: `constitution/spikes/epic-x-typescript-topology-normalization-plan.md`.
- Closure artifacts:
  - `constitution/spikes/epic-x-typescript-topology-normalization-inventory.md`
  - `constitution/spikes/epic-x-typescript-topology-normalization-closure-inventory.md`
- Goal: relocate every TypeScript-only asset out of the language-neutral slots in `boundaries/` so the path topology reveals language ownership without opening files. No semantic changes, no public API renames, no new neutral specs.
- Out of scope: authoring TypeSpec or CDDL for surfaces that lack a neutral source today (`runtime-api`, `driver-api`, `event-stream`, `core-types`); renaming TypeScript packages; moving Rust crates; changing fixtures, suites, or generated artifacts.

**KRT-X001 Topology Inventory**

- **Type:** Spike
- **Effort:** 1
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-W006
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `1.4`, `6`; TechSpec `1.1.2`, `5.1`
- **Description:** Confirm the directory list, package list, Nx project list, and consumer list named in the Epic X plan against live repo state, and freeze them as inputs to the relocation tickets.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the Epic X plan exists
When the topology inventory is recorded
Then every TypeScript-only directory under a language-neutral boundary slot is enumerated
And every consumer of an impacted package is enumerated
And the inventory is committed alongside the plan as a frozen input to the relocation tickets
```

**KRT-X002 Testkit Relocation**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-X001
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `1.4`, `2`, `6`; TechSpec `1.1.2`, `5.1`
- **Description:** Move the kernel, framework, and provider testkit packages out of `boundaries/<area>/testkit/` into `boundaries/<area>/implementations/typescript/testkit/`, update Nx project metadata, regenerate workspace symlinks, and verify all consumer build/typecheck/test/conformance lanes still pass.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the testkit packages currently live at boundary-root testkit slots
When KRT-X002 is complete
Then each testkit package directory lives under boundaries/<area>/implementations/typescript/testkit/
And no testkit consumer requires a package.json edit because of the move
And bun run typecheck, bun run conformance, and per-package nx test targets pass for every consumer
And no fixture, suite manifest, or public package API has been modified
```

**KRT-X003 Contract Implementation Relocation**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-X002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `1.4`, `2`, `6`; TechSpec `1.1.2`, `5.1`
- **Description:** Move the TypeScript package guts of every contract package (`kernel-protocol`, `runtime-api`, `driver-api`, `event-stream`, `tool-contracts`, `provider-api`, `core-types`) into a sibling `implementations/typescript/` directory while leaving language-neutral `spec/`, `artifacts/`, and README assets at the contract root. Update Nx project metadata and verify all build/typecheck/test/conformance lanes.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the contract directories currently mix language-neutral spec assets with TypeScript package guts
When KRT-X003 is complete
Then each contract directory exposes only language-neutral assets at its root and houses TypeScript implementation files under implementations/typescript/
And no consumer package.json requires editing because of the move
And bun run typecheck, bun run conformance, bun run codegen, and per-package nx test targets pass without regression
And no public package API, fixture, suite manifest, or generated artifact has been modified beyond path updates
```

**KRT-X004 Topology Guardrail Documentation**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 2
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-X003
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `1.4`, `6`; TechSpec `1.1.2`, `5.1`
- **Description:** Codify the path-topology rule so the gaps cannot re-emerge. Update `AGENTS.md` boundary-discipline guidance, add a TechSpec ADR pinning the rule, and update Architecture.md `6` to mark the cross-language drift mitigation as enforced through Epic X.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given KRT-X002 and KRT-X003 have moved every TS-only asset into implementations/typescript/
When the topology guardrail documentation is complete
Then AGENTS.md states the path-topology rule explicitly enough that a reviewer can reject misplaced TS-only files
And the TechSpec carries an ADR that names the rule, its rationale, and the deferred Gap C surfaces
And Architecture.md section 6 notes that the cross-language drift mitigation is enforced through Epic X
```

**KRT-X005 Epic X Closure Inventory**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 1
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-X004
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `6`; TechSpec `1.1.2`, `5.1`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Record what Epic X delivered, which gaps it closed, which it deliberately deferred, and the planning-doc status updates needed for the next epic.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given KRT-X001 through KRT-X004 are complete
When the Epic X closure inventory is recorded
Then the closure file lists relocated packages, updated Nx project paths, the topology rule's authority location, and the deferred Gap C surfaces with their rationale
And TechSpec.md and Tasks.md status language is updated to mark Epic X closed in current repo reality
```

### Epic Y - Machine-Enforced Neutral Authority Closure (MENAC)

- Authority-packet closure is closed in current repo reality. Closure artifacts: `constitution/spikes/epic-y-authority-leak-inventory.md` and `constitution/spikes/epic-y-machine-enforced-authority-closure-inventory.md`.
- Final conformance-engine closure is active. Governing spike: `constitution/spikes/epic-y-single-semantic-conformance-engine-spike.md`.
- Goal: Eliminate TypeScript, Rust, generic-runner-source, and Markdown as possible sources of cross-implementation semantic truth by promoting `core-types`, `event-stream`, `runtime-api`, `driver-api`, and callable seams to boundary-owned Authority Packet manifests (TechSpec §4.11), executable Conformance Plans (§4.12), and Implementation Adapter projections (§4.13), then collapse per-language semantic runners into one shared semantic conformance engine over implementation-language adapter hosts. Add CI guardrails per ADR-023, ADR-024, ADR-025, ADR-026, ADR-027, and ADR-028.
- Out of scope: implementing Rust framework product behavior; opening a new product implementation language line; widening kernel/framework semantics beyond the promoted plans; renaming or breaking existing TypeScript public package APIs (which remain declared binding projections of their packets); promoting surfaces beyond the named current scope unless needed to keep existing conformance lanes honest; producing a public compatibility matrix shape change beyond the existing `reports/compatibility/` evidence contract.

**KRT-Y001 Authority Inventory and Conflict Map**

- **Type:** Spike
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-X005
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-037`, `CAP-P1-038`; Architecture `1.2`, `2`, `6`; TechSpec `2 ADR-023..028`, `3.6`
- **Description:** Inventory every place where current docs, specs, READMEs, package manifests, runner source, and Tasks language name TypeScript, Rust, runner code, or Markdown as the source of a cross-implementation semantic. Classify each leak as data shape, operation, ordered stream/channel, cancellation/control, error, lifecycle behavior, recovery behavior, telemetry, transport, conformance assertion, evidence, or implementation-only concern. Map each entry to the surface that should own it.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the Epic Y planning spike exists
When the authority inventory is recorded
Then the constitution carries a closure-eligible inventory file under `constitution/spikes/` that enumerates every TypeScript, Rust, runner-source, and Markdown citation that is currently treated as cross-implementation authority across `boundaries/`, `docs/`, `constitution/`, `AGENTS.md`, and root tooling
And every entry is classified by surface (`core-types`, `event-stream`, `runtime-api`, `driver-api`, callable seam, kernel protocol, telemetry, interop, compatibility, implementation-specific) and by leak kind (shape, operation, ordered channel, control, error, lifecycle, recovery, telemetry, transport, assertion, evidence, implementation-only)
And the inventory names which leaks Epic Y will close, which are deferred to a later epic with rationale, and which are intentionally implementation-specific and therefore not authority leaks
And no entry is left unclassified
```

**KRT-Y002 Authority Packet Manifest and Validator**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y001
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-037`, `CAP-P1-038`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`, `4.6`; TechSpec `2 ADR-026`, `4.11`
- **Description:** Author the Authority Packet manifest JSON Schema at `tools/schemas/authority-packet.schema.json` and the validator/loader under `tools/scripts/authority-packet/` that reads a manifest, verifies declared sources exist, verifies binding projections appear in `forbiddenAuthoritySources`, and verifies that every declared generated artifact has a regenerate command. Wire the validator into the existing `bun run codegen` and `bun run verify` lanes.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the authority inventory is recorded
When the manifest schema and validator are added
Then `tools/schemas/authority-packet.schema.json` exists and matches TechSpec §4.11
And a validator under `tools/scripts/authority-packet/` loads any manifest, validates it against the schema, and fails when a declared source is missing, when a binding projection is not also a forbidden authority source, or when a declared generated artifact lacks a regenerate command
And `bun run codegen` and `bun run verify` invoke the validator across every manifest under `boundaries/`
And no semantic surfaces have been promoted yet; the validator runs against zero or more manifests without introducing one
```

**KRT-Y003 Core Types Authority Packet**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-037`, `CAP-P1-038`, `CAP-P0-012`, `CAP-P0-030`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`, `4.6`; TechSpec `2 ADR-023..028`, `3.6`, `4.11`
- **Description:** Promote `boundaries/shared/contracts/core-types` to a boundary-owned Authority Packet. Author neutral TypeSpec sources for shared identifiers, JSON values, metadata, byte sequences, messages, content parts, tool calls, tool results, provider responses, and stable error envelopes; emit JSON Schema 2020-12 artifacts; declare the manifest with `forbiddenAuthoritySources` covering the TypeScript implementation root, README, docs, and constitution paths.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the manifest validator exists
When the core-types authority packet is promoted
Then `boundaries/shared/contracts/core-types/spec/typespec/` carries the neutral TypeSpec sources and `boundaries/shared/contracts/core-types/artifacts/json-schema/` carries the emitted JSON Schema 2020-12 artifacts
And `boundaries/shared/contracts/core-types/spec/authority-packet.json` declares packetId `tuvren.shared.core-types`, the authoritative TypeSpec sources, the generated JSON Schema artifacts, and the TypeScript implementation root as a binding projection that is also a forbidden authority source
And the existing `@tuvren/core-types` TypeScript package compiles unchanged but is documented as a binding projection of the packet rather than the authority source
And the manifest validator and `bun run codegen` pass for the new packet
```

**KRT-Y004 Event Stream Authority Packet**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y003, KRT-Y008, KRT-Y009

- **Description:** Promote `boundaries/framework/contracts/event-stream` to a boundary-owned Authority Packet covering event families, event identity (`messageId`, `callId`), correlation fields, ordering rules, terminality, replay safety, provider metadata continuity, approval pause/resume projection, adapter projection invariants, and stable error events. Author the corresponding Conformance Plan(s) so the runner asserts the event sequence, terminality, and ordering rules from data rather than from runner code.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the core-types packet, the conformance plan compiler, and the implementation adapter protocol exist
When the event-stream authority packet is promoted
Then `boundaries/framework/contracts/event-stream/spec/` carries neutral TypeSpec or JSON Schema sources for every `TuvrenStreamEvent` family and `boundaries/framework/contracts/event-stream/spec/authority-packet.json` declares packetId `tuvren.framework.event-stream`
And one or more conformance plans under `boundaries/framework/conformance/plans/` express the canonical event sequence, terminal-event rules, ordering rules, and approval pause/resume projection rules using the §4.12 assertion kinds rather than runner-side code
And the existing `@tuvren/event-stream` TypeScript package compiles unchanged and is declared a binding projection in the manifest
And the framework conformance runner consumes the new plans through the §4.13 adapter protocol and the existing event suites pass without runner-side product semantics for the promoted assertions
```

**KRT-Y005 Runtime API Authority Packet**

- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y003, KRT-Y008, KRT-Y009
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-037`, `CAP-P1-038`, `CAP-P0-001`, `CAP-P0-004`, `CAP-P0-005`, `CAP-P0-019`; Architecture `2.1`, `4.5`, `4.6`; TechSpec `2 ADR-023..028`, `3.6`, `4.1`, `4.11`, `4.12`
- **Description:** Promote `boundaries/framework/contracts/runtime-api` to a boundary-owned Authority Packet covering runtime operations, provider calls, tool execution, approval resolution, context transformation, branching, orchestration, cancellation, result recovery, and durable execution behavior. Replace TypeScript-package authority framing with the manifest. Author the conformance plans that drive these operations through the adapter protocol.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the core-types packet, plan compiler, and adapter protocol exist
When the runtime-api authority packet is promoted
Then `boundaries/framework/contracts/runtime-api/spec/typespec/` carries neutral TypeSpec sources for the runtime operations and `boundaries/framework/contracts/runtime-api/spec/authority-packet.json` declares packetId `tuvren.framework.runtime-api` with the TypeScript runtime-core implementation declared as a binding projection and a forbidden authority source
And conformance plans under `boundaries/framework/conformance/plans/` express the runtime lifecycle, cancellation, approval resolve, branching, and recovery semantics using §4.12 assertion kinds
And TechSpec §4.1 is updated in the same change to name the authority packet as the machine authority entry
And the framework conformance runner consumes the runtime-api plans through the §4.13 adapter protocol with no runner-side product semantics for the promoted assertions
```

**KRT-Y006 Driver API Authority Packet**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y003, KRT-Y008, KRT-Y009
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-037`, `CAP-P1-038`, `CAP-P0-023`, `CAP-P0-033`, `CAP-P1-034`; Architecture `2.1`, `4.5`, `4.6`; TechSpec `2 ADR-023..028`, `3.6`, `4.6`, `4.11`, `4.12`
- **Description:** Promote `boundaries/framework/contracts/driver-api` to a boundary-owned Authority Packet covering driver identity, manifest semantics, input/output envelopes, lifecycle hooks, step boundaries, checkpoint obligations, event emission obligations, error obligations, and cancellation obligations. Keep ReAct-specific behavior in ReAct-only conformance plans rather than in driver-neutral packets.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the core-types packet, plan compiler, and adapter protocol exist
When the driver-api authority packet is promoted
Then `boundaries/framework/contracts/driver-api/spec/` carries neutral driver-API sources and `boundaries/framework/contracts/driver-api/spec/authority-packet.json` declares packetId `tuvren.framework.driver-api`
And driver-neutral conformance plans live under `boundaries/framework/conformance/plans/` and ReAct-specific conformance plans live under a separate plan family clearly scoped to the ReAct driver
And the existing `@tuvren/driver-api` TypeScript package compiles unchanged and is declared a binding projection
And no driver-neutral plan asserts ReAct-specific behavior, and no ReAct-specific plan is referenced by the driver-neutral authority packet
```

**KRT-Y007 Callable Seam Authority**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y005, KRT-Y006
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-037`, `CAP-P1-038`, `CAP-P0-013`, `CAP-P0-016`, `CAP-P0-017`; Architecture `2.1`, `4.5`, `4.6`; TechSpec `2 ADR-023..028`, `4.4`, `4.6`, `4.11`, `4.12`, `4.13`
- **Description:** Replace TypeScript-owned callable posture across docs, READMEs, contract specs, and ADR commentary with neutral operation semantics for provider invocation, provider streaming, tool execution, approval resolution, validation failure, structured output, timeout, retry, cancellation, idempotency, and driver hooks. Express each callable as a neutral operation in the relevant authority packet (runtime-api or driver-api) with at least one conformance plan check.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the runtime-api and driver-api authority packets are promoted
When the callable seams are normalized
Then no contract spec, README, ADR, or `constitution/` text claims that any callable seam (provider invoke, provider stream, tool execute, approval resolve, validation failure, structured output, timeout, retry, cancellation, idempotency, driver hook) stays in TypeScript as the source of cross-implementation truth
And every named callable resolves to a neutral operation declared in either the runtime-api or driver-api authority packet
And every named callable has at least one conformance plan check that exercises it through the §4.13 adapter protocol
And TypeScript function signatures and Rust trait shapes for these callables remain only inside the binding appendices declared by their respective authority packets
```

**KRT-Y008 Conformance Plan Compiler**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-037`, `CAP-P1-038`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`, `4.6`; TechSpec `2 ADR-025`, `4.12`
- **Description:** Author the Conformance Plan JSON Schema at `tools/schemas/conformance-plan.schema.json` and the loader/compiler under `tools/conformance/plan-compiler/` that resolves fixtures, validates assertion shapes, expands evidence requirements, and emits a runtime-loadable plan object the transitional TypeScript and Rust conformance entry points can consume. KRT-Y014 and KRT-Y016 supersede this authority-packet-closure ticket for final shared assertion-engine ownership.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the authority packet validator exists
When the conformance plan compiler is added
Then `tools/schemas/conformance-plan.schema.json` exists and matches TechSpec §4.12
And `tools/conformance/plan-compiler/` exposes a loader that validates a plan against the schema, resolves fixtures and scenarios, expands required evidence, and emits a runtime-loadable plan object
And the authority-packet closure layer defines the §4.12 assertion kinds without placing product-specific expected behavior in implementation source
And transitional TypeScript and Rust conformance entry points can consume a sample plan without hard-coding any expected event type, error code, or check id outside the loaded plan
```

**KRT-Y009 Implementation Adapter Protocol**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-037`, `CAP-P1-038`, `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`, `4.6`; TechSpec `2 ADR-025`, `4.13`
- **Description:** Define the initial Implementation Adapter Protocol artifact under `tools/conformance/adapter-protocol/` (neutral protocol document plus per-language binding appendices for TypeScript and Rust) so adapters expose neutral operations, ordered event channels, cancellation, error envelopes, and where applicable durable-state inspection. KRT-Y015 supersedes this initial scaffolding for the final process-level JSON-RPC adapter-host protocol and no-checkId adapter rule.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the authority packet validator exists
When the implementation adapter protocol is published
Then `tools/conformance/adapter-protocol/protocol.md` documents the neutral surface specified in TechSpec §4.13
And `tools/conformance/adapter-protocol/bindings/typescript.md` and `tools/conformance/adapter-protocol/bindings/rust.md` describe the language-native adapter shape for each binding
And reference adapter scaffolds exist for TypeScript and Rust under the appropriate boundary `implementations/<lang>/conformance-runner/` tree and demonstrate dispatching one neutral operation, consuming one ordered event channel, and honoring cancellation
And no adapter encodes product semantics; all assertion logic comes from compiled plans, with final adapter-host evidence ownership removed by KRT-Y015
```

**KRT-Y010 TypeScript Binding Rebase and Rust Projection Alignment**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y004, KRT-Y005, KRT-Y006, KRT-Y007
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-037`, `CAP-P1-038`, `CAP-P0-019`, `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `2.1`, `4.5`, `4.6`; TechSpec `2 ADR-023..028`, `3.6`, `4.1`, `4.6`, `5.1`
- **Description:** Rebase the existing TypeScript packages (`@tuvren/core-types`, `@tuvren/event-stream`, `@tuvren/runtime-api`, `@tuvren/driver-api`, `@tuvren/runtime-core`, `@tuvren/react-driver` where relevant) onto the new authority packets as binding projections, and align the Rust kernel and Rust conformance runner with the matching packet projections. Existing TypeScript public package APIs remain unchanged; only the authority lineage moves to the packets.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the four authority packets and the callable seam normalization are complete
When the TypeScript binding rebase and Rust projection alignment are complete
Then every TypeScript package named above declares its authority packet in its package README and exposes the same public API surface it did before Epic Y
And every Rust crate under `boundaries/<area>/implementations/rust/` that consumes a promoted packet derives its types from the packet projection rather than from a hand-authored Rust source
And `bun run typecheck`, `bun run conformance`, `cargo test --workspace`, and `bun run verify` all pass with no runtime-core, react-driver, or rust-kernel test rewritten to encode product semantics that should live in a conformance plan
And no consumer of the renamed-only files requires a `package.json` edit
```

**KRT-Y011 Machine Authority Guardrails**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y010
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-037`, `CAP-P1-038`; Architecture `1.4`, `4.5`, `4.6`, `6`; TechSpec `2 ADR-023..028`
- **Description:** Add CI guardrails under `tools/scripts/authority-guardrails/` that fail the build when (a) generated artifacts declared by an authority packet differ from regeneration output (ADR-027), (b) a conformance evidence file cites a forbidden authority source declared by its packet (ADR-023, ADR-024), (c) a generic runner source file contains product-semantic literals outside permitted plan-loading code paths (ADR-025), or (d) an authority source uses forbidden implementation vocabulary outside a declared binding appendix (ADR-028). Wire the guardrails into `bun run verify`.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the binding rebase and Rust projection alignment are complete
When the machine authority guardrails are added
Then `bun run verify` runs the freshness check, the forbidden-authority-source check, the runner-oracle check, and the forbidden-vocabulary check across every authority packet
And each guardrail has a regression fixture under `tools/scripts/authority-guardrails/__fixtures__/` that demonstrates a failing input the check rejects with a non-zero exit code
And the four guardrails fail with distinct, actionable messages that name the offending packet, source, or runner file
And no guardrail relies on Markdown text alone to make its claim
```

**KRT-Y012 Epic Y Closure Inventory**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 2
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y011
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-037`, `CAP-P1-038`; Architecture `5`, `6`; TechSpec `2 ADR-023..028`, `5.3`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Record the final authority stack, the promoted surfaces, the remaining deferred surfaces, the compatibility evidence delta, and the future activation gates. Remove or rephrase any stale `constitution/` or `docs/` language that still implies `@tuvren/runtime-api`, another implementation file, a runner source file, or a Markdown document is a cross-implementation semantic authority.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given KRT-Y001 through KRT-Y011 are complete
When the Epic Y closure inventory is recorded
Then `constitution/spikes/epic-y-machine-enforced-authority-closure-inventory.md` lists the promoted authority packets, the conformance plans they reference, the binding projections, the residual deferred surfaces with rationale, and the activation gates a future implementation line must satisfy
And `constitution/Tasks.md` and `constitution/TechSpec.md` are updated in the same change to mark Epic Y authority-packet closure closed in current repo reality and to remove or rephrase stale implementation-, prose-, or runner-authority framing
And `constitution/AGENTS.md` and the root `AGENTS.md` continue to cite the No Implementation Oracle, No Prose Oracle, and No Runner Oracle guardrails as enforced rather than aspirational
And `reports/compatibility/` evidence still passes after the rephrasing without requiring re-measured runs beyond the existing verify lane
```

**KRT-Y013 Single Semantic Engine Spike and Posture**

- **Type:** Spike
- **Effort:** 2
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y012
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-037`, `CAP-P1-038`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`, `4.6`, `6`; TechSpec `2 ADR-025`, `4.12`, `4.13`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Record the architectural correction that final Epic Y closure is one shared semantic conformance engine plus many language adapter hosts, not one independently meaningful runner per language. Update TechSpec, Tasks, closure inventories, and durable agent guidance so review posture and future work use the corrected target.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given Epic Y authority-packet closure has landed
When the final conformance-engine posture is recorded
Then `constitution/spikes/epic-y-single-semantic-conformance-engine-spike.md` explains the shared-runner judgment, adapter-host boundary, adapter-error isolation, no-checkId adapter rule, capability-selection rule, and trace-plan need
And `constitution/TechSpec.md` names `tools/conformance/runner/` as the final semantic engine home and implementation `conformance-adapter/` trees as adapter-host homes
And `constitution/Tasks.md` reopens Epic Y final conformance closure with KRT-Y013 closed as the posture correction and KRT-Y014 through KRT-Y023 as active work
And root `AGENTS.md` no longer describes per-language semantic runners as durable final architecture
```

**KRT-Y014 Shared Semantic Runner Extraction**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y013
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-037`, `CAP-P1-038`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`, `4.6`; TechSpec `2 ADR-025`, `4.12`, `4.13`
- **Description:** Extract the canonical conformance mechanics into `tools/conformance/runner/`. The shared runner must be boundary-agnostic across the current Kraken Engine conformance lanes (kernel, framework/runtime, ReAct driver, and providers): it loads authority packets, loads and validates conformance plans, resolves scenarios/fixtures, executes neutral operations through an adapter client, evaluates generic assertions once, enforces required evidence, isolates adapter errors, and emits compatibility evidence in the existing format.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the corrected Epic Y posture exists
When the shared semantic runner is extracted
Then `tools/conformance/runner/` owns plan loading, scenario loading, fixture loading, assertion evaluation, required-evidence enforcement, adapter-error isolation, capability selection, and evidence writing for kernel, framework/runtime, ReAct driver, and provider conformance lanes
And the runner does not import `@tuvren/runtime-core`, `@tuvren/react-driver`, `@tuvren/stream-core`, `@tuvren/stream-sse`, `@tuvren/stream-agui`, provider bridges, framework testkits, or Rust implementation crates
And existing promoted framework plans can be executed through the shared runner using a temporary TypeScript adapter host without changing the plan assertion literals
And a missing required evidence path fails the check even when all assertion operators pass
```

**KRT-Y015 Adapter Manifest and JSON-RPC Host Protocol**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y014
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`, `CAP-P1-036`, `CAP-P1-038`; Architecture `4.5`, `4.6`; TechSpec `4.13`
- **Description:** Replace the prose-only adapter protocol with a machine-validated adapter manifest and JSON-RPC 2.0 stdio host protocol. Adapter hosts expose native invocation only: initialize, optional instance lifecycle, dispatch, events, inspectState, and shutdown. The protocol must remove check-scoped evidence emission and separate adapter failures from implementation result errors.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the shared semantic runner exists
When the adapter host protocol is formalized
Then `tools/conformance/adapter-protocol/` contains a machine-validated adapter manifest schema with adapterId, protocol version, command, packet/surface declarations, and capabilities
And the protocol document and schema define JSON-RPC 2.0 request/response envelopes over stdio for initialize, createInstance, dispatch, events, inspectState, destroyInstance, and shutdown where applicable
And adapter result observations contain only neutral result, events, state, evidence, and diagnostics fields
And adapters do not receive `checkId`, do not expose `emitEvidence(checkId, ...)`, and do not decide pass/fail
And adapter/protocol errors are reported as adapter errors and cannot satisfy assertions against `$.result.error`
```

**KRT-Y016 Assertion Engine Meta-Conformance**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y014
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-036`, `CAP-P1-038`; Architecture `4.5`, `4.6`; TechSpec `4.12`, `4.13`
- **Description:** Add a conformance-engine meta-conformance corpus that validates the shared assertion engine and any transitional runner mechanics. The corpus must prove every generic operator, missing-path behavior, required-evidence failure, schema validation, ordering behavior, terminal/no-event behavior, exact error matching, and adapter-error isolation.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the shared semantic runner exists
When meta-conformance is added
Then a fixed corpus under `tools/conformance/runner/` or `tools/conformance/meta-conformance/` exercises evidenceField equality, stateField equality, errorEnvelope presence and exact matching, contains over arrays, contains over strings, contains over object keys, regex matching, ordering, noEvent, terminalEvent, schemaValid, missing-path failure, adapter-error isolation, and required-evidence failure
And every corpus case has expected pass/fail evidence checked by an automated target
And `bun run verify` runs the meta-conformance target before compatibility evidence can be refreshed
And no implementation adapter host is needed for the meta-conformance corpus
```

**KRT-Y017 Executable Capability Selection**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y015
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-037`, `CAP-P1-038`; Architecture `4.5`, `4.6`; TechSpec `4.11`, `4.12`, `4.13`
- **Description:** Make plan applicability executable. The shared runner must select checks by capability requirements from conformance plans and adapter-declared capabilities, not by language lane, runner name, implementation ID, or bespoke skip matrix.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given adapter manifests declare capabilities
When the shared runner loads promoted plans
Then it runs only checks whose required capabilities are declared by the adapter and reports non-applicable checks separately from passed or failed checks
And promoted plans contain no implementation adapter IDs, language names, runner names, or implementation-name skip lists
And a regression fixture proves that a plan pinned to `typescript-*`, `rust-*`, or another implementation ID fails validation or guardrails
And compatibility evidence records the adapter capabilities used for selection
```

**KRT-Y018 TypeScript Current-Lane Adapter Host Conversion**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 8
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y017
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-037`, `CAP-P1-038`; Architecture `2.1`, `4.5`, `4.6`; TechSpec `4.12`, `4.13`, `5.1`
- **Description:** Convert current TypeScript conformance entry points into adapter hosts driven by the shared runner, covering the framework/runtime surface, ReAct driver plan family, kernel lane, and provider lane where those lanes already exist. TypeScript adapter code may call native implementation packages and binding projections to execute behavior, but all assertion evaluation, pass/fail decisions, required-evidence checks, and compatibility evidence emission move to the shared runner.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the shared runner, adapter protocol, and capability selection exist
When the TypeScript lanes are converted
Then TypeScript `conformance-adapter/` roots expose adapter manifests and host commands for every current TypeScript conformance lane: framework/runtime, ReAct driver, kernel, and providers where present
And TypeScript adapter source contains no product-semantic assertion literals, check IDs, pass/fail grading, required-evidence grading, or compatibility evidence writer
And the shared runner drives the TypeScript adapter hosts and reports checks from native TypeScript implementation behavior
And TypeScript conformance remains green only where native implementation logic produces the expected observations
```

**KRT-Y019 Rust Current-Lane Adapter Host Conversion**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 8
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y017
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-037`, `CAP-P1-038`; Architecture `2.1`, `4.5`, `4.6`; TechSpec `4.12`, `4.13`, `5.1`
- **Description:** Convert current Rust conformance entry points into adapter hosts driven by the shared runner, covering the Rust kernel lane and the Rust framework red lane. Rust hosts should honestly return adapter observations or adapter-operation-not-implemented errors based on native Rust code availability; they must not implement assertion semantics or manufacture passing implementation evidence.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the shared runner, adapter protocol, and capability selection exist
When the Rust lanes are converted
Then Rust `conformance-adapter/` roots expose adapter manifests and host commands for every current Rust conformance lane: kernel and framework where present
And Rust adapter source contains no assertion engine, check IDs, pass/fail grading, required-evidence grading, or compatibility evidence writer
And the shared runner drives the Rust adapter hosts and reports failed checks where native Rust behavior is not implemented
And unimplemented Rust adapter errors cannot satisfy implementation error-envelope assertions
```

**KRT-Y020 Runner and Adapter Authority Guardrails**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y016, KRT-Y018, KRT-Y019
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-037`, `CAP-P1-038`; Architecture `1.4`, `4.5`, `4.6`, `6`; TechSpec `2 ADR-023..028`, `4.12`, `4.13`
- **Description:** Harden authority guardrails for the shared-runner architecture. Guardrails must scan every implementation conformance runner or adapter host root across TypeScript, Rust, and future languages for product-semantic assertion ownership, check IDs, plan literals, pass/fail grading, check-scoped evidence, fixture replay counted as implementation conformance, and adapter errors satisfying implementation assertions.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given TypeScript and Rust adapter hosts are driven by the shared runner
When authority guardrails run
Then implementation adapter roots and any remaining transitional conformance-runner roots are scanned across all current language lanes
And guardrails fail when implementation source contains check IDs, assertion literals, pass/fail grading, required-evidence grading, check-scoped evidence emission, or direct fixture-to-pass conformance paths
And guardrails fail when adapter errors are mapped into implementation result errors for promoted plan assertions
And normal `conformance`, `codegen`, and `verify` commands fail when structured evidence has `status: "fail"`, while `compatibility:evidence` remains the only evidence-refresh lane that can intentionally record red TDD evidence
```

**KRT-Y021 Trace Plan Extension Spike**

- **Type:** Spike
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y014, KRT-Y015
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-037`, `CAP-P1-036`, `CAP-P1-038`; Architecture `4.5`, `4.6`; TechSpec `4.12`, `4.13`
- **Description:** Design the minimal `steps[]` extension for conformance plans so lifecycle-heavy behavior can be proven as a state machine. The spike must cover variable references to prior step outputs, fixture references, per-step controls, per-step assertions, instance lifecycle, and state inspection without giving adapters check IDs or assertion authority.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the shared runner and adapter protocol exist
When the trace-plan spike is completed
Then the spike documents the proposed `steps[]` schema, variable-reference model, fixture-reference model, per-step assertion model, adapter instance-lifecycle needs, and compatibility evidence shape
And the design includes approval pause/resume continuity, checkpoint/recovery, branch-from-completed-head, and event-timed cancellation as target examples
And the design explicitly rejects plan behavior that can be satisfied by echoing controls, replaying fixtures, or manufacturing runner-side state
And TechSpec §4.12 has enough detail for implementation without inventing schema semantics during coding
```

**KRT-Y022 Trace Plan Execution Support**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 8
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y016, KRT-Y017, KRT-Y021
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-037`, `CAP-P1-036`, `CAP-P1-038`; Architecture `4.5`, `4.6`; TechSpec `4.12`, `4.13`
- **Description:** Implement trace-plan support in the plan schema, compiler, shared runner, adapter client, and promoted framework plans where single-operation checks cannot honestly prove lifecycle semantics. Convert vulnerable cancellation, approval resume, recovery, branching, and checkpoint-like checks to trace plans that require implementation-produced state transitions.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the trace-plan design is accepted
When trace execution support is implemented
Then `tools/schemas/conformance-plan.schema.json` and `tools/conformance/plan-compiler/` validate and compile `steps[]` plans
And the shared runner resolves prior-step references, executes steps against the same adapter instance when required, applies per-step controls, evaluates per-step assertions, and emits per-step evidence
And promoted lifecycle checks for cancellation timing, approval resume continuity, branch-from-completed-head, context transformation, result recovery, and checkpoint-like behavior require implementation-produced observations rather than runner-manufactured proof
And TypeScript evidence remains green only where native implementation logic satisfies the trace, while Rust evidence remains red where native Rust framework behavior is not implemented
```

**KRT-Y023 Final Epic Y Conformance Closure**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y020, KRT-Y022
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-037`, `CAP-P1-038`; Architecture `5`, `6`; TechSpec `5.3`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Refresh compatibility evidence and record final Epic Y closure only after the shared runner, adapter hosts, guardrails, meta-conformance, capability selection, and trace-plan coverage are in place. The closure inventory must precisely list which TypeScript and Rust checks pass, fail, or are non-applicable based on native implementation behavior.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given KRT-Y013 through KRT-Y022 are complete
When final Epic Y closure is recorded
Then `reports/compatibility/` evidence is refreshed through the shared runner and records TypeScript, Rust, kernel, framework/runtime, ReAct driver, and provider lanes with pass, fail, and non-applicable counts tied to actual adapter observations
And `bun run conformance`, `bun run codegen`, and `bun run verify` fail on red structured evidence while `bun run compatibility:evidence` refreshes red TDD evidence intentionally
And the final closure inventory names the shared runner, adapter hosts, promoted plans, trace plans, guardrails, and exact remaining deferred implementation gaps
And `constitution/Tasks.md`, `constitution/TechSpec.md`, and root `AGENTS.md` mark Epic Y final conformance closure complete without claiming TypeScript, Rust, runner source, adapter source, or Markdown as cross-implementation authority
```

### Epic Z - TypeScript Kernel Syscall Closure (TKSC)

**KRT-Z001 RuntimeKernel Package Contract**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Y023
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** `docs/KrakenKernelSpecification.md` §7; TechSpec §4.2, §4.3, §5.1
- **Description:** Add the `@tuvren/kernel-runtime` package under `boundaries/kernel/implementations/typescript/runtime-kernel` and define it as the sole boundary-owned TypeScript adapter from `RuntimeBackend` to the frozen `RuntimeKernel` syscall surface. Host-owned playground kernel code becomes transitional until KRT-Z005.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the TypeScript kernel boundary has protocol types and backend adapters but no boundary-owned RuntimeKernel implementation
When KRT-Z001 is complete
Then `@tuvren/kernel-runtime` exists under the kernel TypeScript implementation tree and exports `createRuntimeKernel`
And the package depends on `@tuvren/kernel-protocol` and official backend contracts without moving runtime code into host or framework boundaries
And the public package surface exposes only the kernel implementation entrypoints and test-visible types needed by later tickets
```

**KRT-Z002 Schema and Tree Syscalls**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Z001
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** Kernel spec §3.2, §7, Appendix B; TechSpec §3.3, §4.2
- **Description:** Implement strict schema and TurnTree syscall semantics: duplicate schema registration rejection, required full manifests for base-less `tree.create`, schema-path validation, incorporation-rule rejection for unmatched staged object types, same-schema `tree.diff`, and unknown-path errors for `tree.resolve`.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given a registered TurnTreeSchema and stored objects
When TypeScript callers invoke schema and tree operations through `@tuvren/kernel-runtime`
Then every validation rule in the kernel spec Appendix B for schema and tree operations is enforced
And invalid paths, wrong collection kinds, different-schema diffs, missing incorporation rules, and incomplete base-less manifests fail before persistence
And valid tree operations produce deterministic hashes and manifests that remain backend-neutral across memory and SQLite
```

**KRT-Z003 Lineage and Branch Syscalls**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Z002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** Kernel spec §4, §8.2; TechSpec §4.2
- **Description:** Implement lineage-proven membership and branch-head semantics for thread, node, branch, and turn operations, including cross-thread rejection, invalid `node.walkBack` rejection, forward/backward/lateral head movement classification, archival rollback branch creation, and failed active runs on abandoned rollback segments.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given multiple Threads and Branches with divergent TurnNode histories
When branch, node, thread, or turn syscalls reference TurnNodes across or outside their lineage
Then cross-thread and lateral references are rejected with lineage-specific errors
And backward `branch.setHead` atomically creates an archive Branch, preserves the abandoned head, fails affected running or paused Runs, and returns both Branch records
And no TurnNode becomes orphaned after a successful rollback
```

**KRT-Z004 Run Checkpoint Recovery Observe**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Z003
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** Kernel spec §5, §6.4, §8.2; TechSpec §3.2, §4.2
- **Description:** Complete run lifecycle semantics for planned checkpoints, reactive checkpoints, running-only `beginStep`/`completeStep`, event and tree validation, accurate `run.recover`, ObserveResult annotation persistence, signal handoff to the next step, and fixed verdict priority composition.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given a running Run with declared deterministic and side-effecting steps
When steps complete, terminate, pause, fail, or recover through `@tuvren/kernel-runtime`
Then checkpoint creation follows the documented planned and reactive rules atomically
And `run.recover` returns consumed StagedResults from the last TurnNode plus durable uncommitted StagedResults
And ObserveResult annotations are durably recorded outside TurnNode identity while signals appear on the next StepContext for the same Run
And `verdicts.compose` applies Abort, Pause, Modify, Retry, Proceed priority with first-objection-wins inside each priority tier
```

**KRT-Z005 Framework and Playground Migration**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 3
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Z004
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** TechSpec §1.2, §4.1, §4.2, §5.1
- **Description:** Replace the private playground-local TypeScript kernel implementation with `@tuvren/kernel-runtime` while preserving host helpers and runtime-core behavior. The playground may keep read inspectors, but syscall semantics must live in the kernel boundary package.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the playground host currently owns a private local RuntimeKernel facade
When the playground runs in local memory or SQLite kernel mode
Then it obtains syscall behavior from `@tuvren/kernel-runtime`
And host-specific inspector helpers remain host-owned without duplicating kernel semantics
And existing runtime-core and playground tests continue to validate user-visible behavior through the new boundary-owned kernel implementation
```

### Epic AA - Kernel Conformance Promotion (KCP)

**KRT-AA001 Kernel Conformance Authority Update**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 5
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Z005
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** TechSpec §4.11, §4.12, §4.13
- **Description:** Extend the kernel protocol authority packet and conformance plans to cover `kernel.syscall`, `kernel.logical`, and `kernel.observe` capabilities without making implementation source, runner source, or Markdown the oracle.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given Epic Y established authority packets and shared-runner conformance plans
When kernel syscall conformance is promoted
Then the kernel protocol authority packet references the new or extended conformance plans and fixtures
And every new check declares capability requirements, required evidence, assertions, and neutral operations
And Markdown and TypeScript source remain explanatory or binding projections rather than cross-implementation authority
```

**KRT-AA002 TypeScript Adapter Operations**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 3
- **Dependencies:** KRT-AA001
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** TechSpec §4.13; Kernel conformance plans
- **Description:** Extend the TypeScript kernel conformance adapter to invoke `@tuvren/kernel-runtime` against memory and SQLite-backed scenarios and return neutral observations for promoted syscall, logical, and observe operations.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the shared runner dispatches neutral kernel conformance operations
When the TypeScript kernel adapter advertises promoted kernel capabilities
Then it executes native TypeScript kernel behavior through `@tuvren/kernel-runtime`
And it returns observations only, without deciding pass/fail, receiving check IDs, or emitting check-scoped evidence
And adapter errors remain isolated from implementation assertion failures
```

**KRT-AA003 Syscall Assertions and Evidence**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Dependencies:** KRT-AA002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** Kernel spec Appendix B; TechSpec §4.12
- **Description:** Add assertion-bearing conformance coverage for schema/tree strictness, lineage rejection, branch rollback archival, recovery state, verdict composition, observe persistence, and logical kernel behaviors currently reported as non-applicable for TypeScript.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the TypeScript adapter provides native observations for promoted kernel operations
When shared-runner conformance executes the kernel plans
Then validation, lineage, rollback, recovery, verdict, and observe checks pass or fail from implementation-produced evidence
And TypeScript no longer reports `kernel.logical.diff_paths`, `kernel.logical.branch_list`, `kernel.logical.recovery_state`, or `kernel.lineage.cross_thread_rejection` as non-applicable once native support exists
And every required evidence field is present or the shared runner fails the check
```

**KRT-AA004 Compatibility Evidence Refresh**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 3
- **Dependencies:** KRT-AA003
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** TechSpec §4.10, §4.12
- **Description:** Refresh kernel compatibility evidence and compatibility matrix output after promoted TypeScript kernel conformance runs through the shared runner.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given kernel conformance plans and TypeScript adapter operations cover promoted syscall behavior
When compatibility evidence is refreshed
Then `reports/compatibility/` records TypeScript kernel pass, fail, and non-applicable status from shared-runner evidence
And normal `conformance`, `codegen`, and `verify` gates fail on structured failed evidence
And Rust kernel results remain capability-scoped rather than inferred from TypeScript behavior
```

### Epic AB - Run Liveness and Stale-Running Recovery (RLSR)

- Epic AB has landed in current repo reality through the advertised `kernel.run-liveness` extension, backend-neutral lease storage and validators, stale-run preemption semantics, shared kernel and framework conformance coverage, and refreshed compatibility evidence.

**KRT-AB001 Liveness Extension Contract**

- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Dependencies:** KRT-AA004
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** Kernel spec §5.2, §5.7, Appendix A; TechSpec §3.2, §4.2
- **Description:** Formalize the `kernel.run-liveness` extension as a capability separate from the frozen 28-operation base, including TypeScript protocol helper types, storage fields, error semantics, and conformance plan membership.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given stale-running recovery requires leases but the frozen base syscall list has no lease operation
When the liveness extension contract is added
Then leased Run ownership is represented as an optional advertised capability
And extension types define owner ID, lease expiry, fencing token, preemption reason, renewal, expired-run listing, and preemption result semantics
And the base `RuntimeKernel` interface remains compatible for non-liveness implementations
```

**KRT-AB002 Lease Storage and Validators**

- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Dependencies:** KRT-AB001
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** TechSpec §3.2, §3.4, §3.5
- **Description:** Add memory and SQLite storage support for leased running ownership, including compare-and-swap renewal by owner and fencing token, expired-run lookup, and validators that keep paused Runs outside lease expiry semantics.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given a Run was created with leased running ownership
When its owner renews, another owner attempts renewal, or the lease expires
Then renewal succeeds only for the current owner and fencing token while the Run remains running
And expired running Runs can be discovered through backend-neutral access paths
And paused, completed, and failed Runs are not lease-expiry candidates
```

**KRT-AB003 Preemption Semantics**

- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Dependencies:** KRT-AB002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** Kernel spec §5.2, §5.7; TechSpec §4.2
- **Description:** Implement stale-running preemption semantics: verify expiry atomically, fence the stale owner, preserve verifiable staged work through reactive checkpointing where required, mark the stale Run failed with preemption reason, and return recovery state for replacement execution.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given a leased running Run has expired while durable staged work may exist
When a new owner preempts the stale Run
Then the kernel atomically verifies expiry, records preemption, fails the stale Run, and returns RecoveryState for a new replacement Run
And the stale Run is never reopened
And a non-expired running Run or paused Run cannot be preempted through stale-running recovery
```

**KRT-AB004 Liveness Conformance Evidence**

- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 5
- **Dependencies:** KRT-AB003
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** TechSpec §4.10, §4.12, §4.13
- **Description:** Promote `kernel.run-liveness` conformance plans and refresh shared compatibility evidence for the TypeScript kernel extension while keeping backend-specific memory/SQLite lease storage and migration behavior covered by their implementation test lanes, leaving Rust non-applicable unless it advertises the extension capability.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given TypeScript implements the run-liveness extension
When shared-runner liveness conformance executes
Then lease renewal, expired-run discovery, stale preemption, paused exclusion, and replacement recovery state are verified from implementation-produced evidence
And shared TypeScript kernel evidence plus backend-specific memory/SQLite verification report honest pass/fail status for the extension
And Rust evidence is non-applicable unless a Rust adapter advertises `kernel.run-liveness`
```
