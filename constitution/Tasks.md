## 1. Executive Summary & Active Critical Path

- **Total Active Story Points:** 12
- **Critical Path:** Epic X TypeScript Topology Normalization. KRT-X001 -> KRT-X002 -> KRT-X003 -> KRT-X004 -> KRT-X005.
- **Planning Assumptions:** Epics A-W are closed in current repo reality. Epic X is now active as a structural follow-up to Epic W: it relocates TS-only assets out of the language-neutral slots in `boundaries/` so the tree topology stops implying TypeScript ownership of contract or testkit roots before another implementation line becomes authoritative. Epic X is not a re-opening of Epic W semantic decisions and does not author new neutral specs for surfaces that lack one today. Epic U closure evidence lives in `constitution/spikes/epic-u-rust-kernel-baseline-inventory.md`, Epic V closure evidence lives in `constitution/spikes/epic-v-transport-decision-inventory.md` plus `constitution/spikes/epic-v-framework-rust-kernel-interop-closure-inventory.md`, and Epic W closure evidence now lives in `constitution/spikes/epic-w-semantic-coverage-matrix.md` plus `constitution/spikes/epic-w-semantic-ecosystem-maturity-closure-inventory.md`. TechSpec v0.6.9 keeps the baseline AI SDK bridge on `LanguageModelV3` / `ProviderV3` from `@ai-sdk/provider@3.0.8`, pins the AG-UI adapter to `@ag-ui/core@0.0.52`, preserves the existing `ProviderStreamChunk` seam while documenting the current tool-call metadata continuity requirements, treats tee-based fanout above `ExecutionHandle.events()` as the sanctioned multi-consumer host path when every required tee branch subscribes before the first pull, records SQLite playground validation as a Node-backed path because `@tuvren/backend-sqlite` uses `better-sqlite3`, keeps the playground-owned automated aimock provider lanes across OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini as local validation rather than a public provider contract, records the manual Gemini lane as an opt-in local proof rather than default automation, treats Buf `FILE` compatibility as the default interop gate from the first `.proto` merge, and treats the compatibility matrix as a conservative near-public readiness signal with named check summaries rather than suite-only smoke claims.

### Brownfield Continuity Note

- The current codebase already contains the workspace scaffold, shared core types, kernel protocol package, memory backend, SQLite backend, kernel testkit, shared framework contract packages, provider contract package, `runtime-core`, and the ReAct Driver foundation package.
- Current repository reality includes closed Epic K, L, M, N, O, and P behavior with explicit closure artifacts in `constitution/spikes/epic-k-react-loop-cancellation-inventory.md`, `constitution/spikes/epic-l-parity-inventory.md`, `constitution/spikes/epic-m-tool-approval-gap-inventory.md`, `constitution/spikes/epic-n-ai-sdk-bridge-inventory.md`, `constitution/spikes/epic-o-stream-adapter-inventory.md`, and `constitution/spikes/epic-p-playground-host-inventory.md`.
- `KRT-Q001` is now closed in current repo reality through `constitution/spikes/epic-q-hardening-gap-inventory.md`, which inventories the extraction targets, release-check targets, portability matrix, deferred Deno work, and remaining hardening gaps for the rest of Epic Q.
- The Epic Q target packages now exist under `boundaries/framework/testkit` and `boundaries/providers/testkit`, with release/verification scripts under `tools/scripts`.
- The private playground host now also owns automated aimock E2E validation lanes that exercise `@tuvren/provider-bridge-ai-sdk` through local OpenAI-, Anthropic-, and Gemini-compatible HTTP mock provider boundaries without provider credentials, covering streamed text, structured output, tool continuation, approval pause/resume, provider metadata, cancellation, provider failure, malformed responses, and unmatched fixtures.
- The private playground host now also exposes an opt-in `host-playground:scenario-gemini` lane that exercises the same bridge through `@ai-sdk/google@3.0.64` and real Gemini credentials for streaming, metadata, structured output, multi-step streamed tool continuity, and approval resume behavior without moving live-provider cost and flake into default verification.
- Those Epic Q testkit packages are now helper/facade packages; compatibility evidence flows through implementation-scoped TypeScript conformance runners over shared boundary-owned assets.
- Planning verification confirmed `ai@6.0.142` and `@ai-sdk/provider@3.0.8` are available and that `@ai-sdk/provider@3.0.8` exports `LanguageModelV3`, `ProviderV3`, `LanguageModelV3CallOptions`, `LanguageModelV3GenerateResult`, and `LanguageModelV3StreamPart`.
- Epic N now extends repo reality beyond those planning notes: the bridge package exists and the closure artifact above is the authoritative upstream seam for Epic O.
- Epic O now extends repo reality beyond those planning notes: `@tuvren/stream-core`, `@tuvren/stream-sse`, and `@tuvren/stream-agui` exist, `constitution/spikes/epic-o-stream-adapter-inventory.md` is the authoritative adapter mapping record, and Epic P must treat tee-based fanout plus the documented `tuvren.runtime.*` AG-UI custom namespace as the handoff surface rather than rediscovering protocol gaps or resubscription hazards.
- Epic P now extends repo reality beyond those planning notes: `@tuvren/playground-host` exists under `boundaries/hosts/implementations/typescript/playground`, `constitution/spikes/epic-p-playground-host-inventory.md` is the authoritative playground handoff, full-turn streams cover canonical/SSE/AG-UI fanout, approval resume continuation is projected to canonical/SSE only, non-reload memory scenarios run under Bun tests, branching is validated from a completed source head, and SQLite reload is validated through the built Node CLI path.
- Epic R now extends repo reality beyond those planning notes: the repository has the explicit multi-language transition guide plus the closure inventory in `constitution/spikes/epic-r-multilanguage-transition-foundation-inventory.md`, Epic S has since closed the artifact promotion line, Epic T has since closed the kernel interop governance line, Epic U has since closed the Rust kernel baseline line, and Epic V has since closed the TypeScript framework to Rust kernel interop stabilization line.

### Sequential Scope Rule

- Epic V is closed. Epic W starts from the measured compatibility evidence and the Epic V closure inventories, but it is not Rust framework work. Epic W must mature the semantic ecosystem itself: coverage matrix, assertion-bearing conformance suites, promoted TypeScript-local semantics, and compatibility evidence precise enough for future implementations to consume without treating TypeScript as the oracle.
- Epic W is closed. Epic X is a structural normalization that relocates TS-only assets out of language-neutral boundary slots without changing semantics, conformance suites, fixtures, public package APIs, or generated artifacts. Authoring neutral specs for surfaces that lack one today (`runtime-api`, `driver-api`, `event-stream`, `core-types`) is explicitly out of Epic X scope and remains deferred for a later epic.

### Planning Heuristic

- Prefer epic slices that look likely to land comfortably below roughly `5,000` lines of new code and treat roughly `10,000` lines as a warning threshold.
- This is a scoping heuristic for planning clarity, not an execution cap or a substitute for code review judgment.

## 2. Project Phasing & Iteration Strategy

### Delivery Cadence Posture

- No sprint or release-train cadence is assumed in this plan.
- This section uses "iteration strategy" only because the planning framework requires that heading; the content below is dependency phasing and scope partitioning, not a commitment to Scrum-style iterations.

### Current Active Scope

- Epic X TypeScript Topology Normalization is active. The plan lives in `constitution/spikes/epic-x-typescript-topology-normalization-plan.md` and the ticket list under `4.` Epic X below is the authoritative ticket surface.
- Epic W is closed in current repo reality through `constitution/spikes/epic-w-semantic-coverage-matrix.md` and `constitution/spikes/epic-w-semantic-ecosystem-maturity-closure-inventory.md`.
- Future implementation-line work must start from the named semantic evidence captured there instead of reopening TypeScript-local semantic authority by default. Epic X must close before any future epic that would add another language implementation surface inside `boundaries/`.

### Future / Deferred Scope

- Rust framework implementation work is deferred beyond Epic W and requires a later TechSpec revision that cites Epic W evidence.
- `LanguageModelV2` / `ProviderV2` compatibility is deferred.
- AI SDK agent loops, AI SDK UI message protocols, AI SDK transport helpers, LangChain bridges, provider-native tool support, and first-class Tuvren provider packages are deferred.
- ACP or any additional host protocol beyond SSE and AG-UI is deferred until a future TechSpec revision names it.
- Future concrete drivers beyond ReAct, official peer backends beyond memory/SQLite, and future language lines beyond Rust are deferred beyond Epic W unless a later TechSpec revision activates them from the matured semantic evidence.
- FFI-based Rust embedding is deferred until after the process-boundary kernel seam is proven boring and durable.
- Deno portability checks are deferred until public package surfaces stabilize enough to avoid testing scaffolding churn.

### Archived or Already Completed Scope

- Epics A-J established the architecture-first monorepo, shared core types, kernel protocol, memory and SQLite backends, shared framework contracts, `runtime-core`, the first ReAct driver slice, and the runtime-foundation hardening line.
- Epics K-M closed the first production-depth ReAct loop, streaming/provider parity, and tool/approval integration; authoritative closure evidence lives in `constitution/spikes/epic-k-react-loop-cancellation-inventory.md`, `constitution/spikes/epic-l-parity-inventory.md`, and `constitution/spikes/epic-m-tool-approval-gap-inventory.md`.
- Epics N-Q closed the post-ReAct TypeScript expansion line for the AI SDK bridge, host stream adapters, playground host harness, and release/portability hardening; authoritative closure evidence lives in `constitution/spikes/epic-n-ai-sdk-bridge-inventory.md`, `constitution/spikes/epic-o-stream-adapter-inventory.md`, `constitution/spikes/epic-p-playground-host-inventory.md`, and `constitution/spikes/epic-q-release-hardening-inventory.md`. That closure line now includes automated aimock provider-boundary coverage across OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini plus an opt-in real Gemini playground lane without reactivating the closed Epic Q backlog.
- Epic R closed the multi-language transition foundation through `constitution/spikes/epic-r-multilanguage-transition-guide.md` and `constitution/spikes/epic-r-multilanguage-transition-foundation-inventory.md`, delivering boundary-owned conformance and contract scaffold, canonical target vocabulary, telemetry codegen authority, and the first measured TypeScript-only compatibility baseline.
- Epic S closed boundary contract and conformance artifactization through `constitution/spikes/epic-s-boundary-contract-conformance-artifactization-inventory.md`, delivering TypeSpec-authored tool/provider artifacts, kernel CDDL grammar, implementation-scoped TypeScript conformance runners, and compatibility evidence sourced from those runners.
- Epic T closed kernel interop governance through `constitution/spikes/epic-t-kernel-interop-surface-inventory.md` and `constitution/spikes/epic-t-kernel-interop-governance-inventory.md`, delivering the governed kernel-only proto authority and Buf-backed interop governance lane.
- Epic U closed the Rust kernel baseline through `constitution/spikes/epic-u-rust-kernel-baseline-inventory.md`, delivering the root Cargo workspace, Rust kernel core, Rust conformance runner, runnable Rust gRPC service, and Rust telemetry helper without adding a TypeScript transport client or Rust framework path.
- Epic V closed TypeScript framework to Rust kernel interop stabilization through `constitution/spikes/epic-v-transport-decision-inventory.md` and `constitution/spikes/epic-v-framework-rust-kernel-interop-closure-inventory.md`, delivering the TypeScript gRPC transport helper, runtime selection seam, real interop-smoke evidence, compatibility-ledger interop entries, and separated cross-language verification.
- Rust framework start is no longer Epic W. It is deferred behind Epic W's semantic maturity evidence.

## 4. Ticket List

### Epic R - Multilanguage Transition Foundation (MTF)

- Epic R is closed in current repo reality.
- Closure artifacts:
  - `constitution/spikes/epic-r-multilanguage-transition-guide.md`
  - `constitution/spikes/epic-r-multilanguage-transition-foundation-inventory.md`
- Durable outcome:
  - the constitution now records the authority stack, target repo shape, migration phases, and Rust-kernel-first transition rule
  - the repo now contains boundary-owned conformance roots, future contract-authority homes, the kernel interop home, canonical `lint` / `conformance` / `codegen` targets, a formal telemetry semantic-convention source plus generated outputs, and a measured TypeScript-only compatibility baseline
  - the TypeScript testkits remain helper/facade packages over language-agnostic assets rather than compatibility-evidence authority
  - Epic S has closed the artifact promotion work that follows this foundation

**KRT-R001 Multilanguage Transition Guide**

- **Type:** Spike
- **Effort:** 2
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-Q006

- **Description:** Formalize the multi-language transition guide into the constitution so the next implementation line begins from explicit repo-owned authority instead of ad hoc portability assumptions.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given Epic Q is closed in current repo reality
When the multilanguage transition guide is formalized
Then the constitution records the authority stack, target repo shape, migration phases, immediate guardrails, and the Tasks and TechSpec status language for the next implementation line
```

**KRT-R002 Boundary-Owned Transition Scaffolding**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-R001
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2`, `5`; TechSpec `3.6`, `5.1`, `5.1.1`
- **Description:** Add the first substantial boundary-owned `conformance/`, `interop/`, `telemetry/`, and `reports/compatibility/` scaffolding needed by the transition line while preserving current TypeScript package behavior.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the transition guide is the new planning handoff
When boundary-owned transition scaffolding is added
Then the owning boundaries and repo root have the planned artifact homes for conformance, interop, telemetry, and compatibility reporting
And the new structure creates a meaningful early slice of the target repo shape rather than only placeholder stubs
And the existing TypeScript implementation path still builds and tests without semantic rewrites
```

**KRT-R003 Canonical Target Vocabulary and Tool Wrappers**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-R002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `2.1`, `5`; TechSpec `1.1`, `5.1.1`, `5.2`
- **Description:** Define the canonical repo-wide target vocabulary and wire Nx/tool wrappers so `build`, `test`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `conformance`, `codegen`, and `interop-smoke` delegate to the native toolchain for each active ecosystem.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the transition scaffolding exists
When canonical targets and wrappers are introduced
Then relevant projects expose the shared target vocabulary
And each target delegates to Bun, Cargo, Buf, or another native tool rather than replacing it with TypeScript-specific orchestration logic
```

**KRT-R004 Telemetry Semantic-Convention Source and Compatibility Contract**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 2
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-R003
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `4.5`, `5`; TechSpec `3.6`, `4.10`, `5.2`
- **Description:** Add the formal telemetry semantic-convention source plus the compatibility-ledger contract so later cross-language work has a stable evidence surface before Rust code lands.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the transition foundation is active
When the telemetry semantic-convention source and compatibility contract are added
Then the repository contains an authored OpenTelemetry semantic-convention source plus reviewed compatibility-ledger shape definitions
And the telemetry source is ready to drive generated TypeScript and Rust constants or helpers for current and future implementation lines
And no hand-authored pass or fail claims are recorded in place of measured suite evidence
```

### Epic S - Boundary Contract and Conformance Artifactization (BCA)

- Closed in current repo reality. Closure evidence lives in `constitution/spikes/epic-s-boundary-contract-conformance-artifactization-inventory.md`.

**KRT-S001 Contract Promotion Inventory**

- **Type:** Spike
- **Effort:** 2
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.

- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`; TechSpec `3.6`, `4.8`, `5.1`
- **Description:** Inventory which framework and provider contract packages should promote TypeSpec now, which should remain unchanged for now, and how current testkit responsibilities map onto future boundary-owned conformance assets.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the transition scaffolding and target vocabulary exist
When the contract promotion inventory is completed
Then the repository records which contract packages adopt TypeSpec now, which stay unchanged, which artifacts each emits, and how current testkit responsibilities map into future conformance ownership
```

**KRT-S002 Framework and Provider TypeSpec Promotion**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-S001
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-019`, `CAP-P0-020`, `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `2`, `5`; TechSpec `3.6`, `4.8`, `5.2`
- **Description:** Promote the selected framework and provider contract packages to authored TypeSpec sources and emit reviewed JSON Schema/OpenAPI artifacts without changing the shared semantic meaning of their public contracts.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the promotion inventory names the first contract packages
When TypeSpec promotion is complete
Then each selected contract package contains boundary-owned TypeSpec sources and emitted JSON Schema and OpenAPI artifacts
And the public contract meaning stays aligned with the existing runtime semantics and docs
```

**KRT-S003 Kernel CDDL Grammar**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-S001
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-001`, `CAP-P0-004`, `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`; TechSpec `3.1`, `3.6`, `4.8`
- **Description:** Add CDDL-authored kernel record grammar for the canonical protocol records, manifests, runs, and recovery-shaped payloads without treating grammar as semantic authority over behavior.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the transition inventory has named the kernel artifact work
When kernel CDDL grammar is added
Then canonical kernel record families are represented under boundary-owned CDDL
And the grammar aligns with current protocol shapes without redefining recovery or lineage semantics in place of the docs
```

**KRT-S004 Conformance Asset Split and TypeScript Runners**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-S002, KRT-S003
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-005`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`; TechSpec `3.6`, `4.8`, `5.2`
- **Description:** Split the current TypeScript-first testkit responsibilities into boundary-owned conformance schemas, fixtures, and scenarios plus TypeScript-specific runners that consume those suites as one peer implementation path among many.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given contract packages and kernel grammar have authored machine-readable sources
When the conformance split is complete
Then the owning boundaries contain shared conformance schemas, fixtures, and scenarios
And the TypeScript implementation runs those suites through implementation-specific runners instead of treating testkit helpers as the semantic authority
And the resulting structure makes TypeScript one peer consumer of the shared behavioral corpus rather than the root implementation authority
```

### Epic T - Kernel Interop Governance (KIG)

- Closed in current repo reality.
- Closure artifacts:
  - `constitution/spikes/epic-t-kernel-interop-surface-inventory.md`
  - `constitution/spikes/epic-t-kernel-interop-governance-inventory.md`
- Durable outcome:
  - the repo now contains kernel-only proto authority under `boundaries/kernel/interop/grpc/proto/`
  - root Buf v2 lint, generation, and `FILE` breaking governance are in place
  - Devenv declares the native Buf and Protobuf-ES generator tooling
  - generated bindings are placed under the consuming framework implementation tree and ignored by source control
  - `kernel-interop-grpc` exposes `codegen` and `interop-smoke` lanes without claiming real Rust interop evidence early

**KRT-T001 Kernel Interop Surface Inventory**

- **Type:** Spike
- **Effort:** 2
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-S004
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`; TechSpec `4.9`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Inventory the narrow kernel-only interop surface, transport non-goals, versioning posture, and event/error envelope boundaries before authoring `.proto` files, including the existing thread/branch/head operations the framework must preserve over a remote kernel path.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given boundary-owned conformance assets now exist
When the kernel interop surface inventory is completed
Then the repository records the kernel operations, event and error envelopes, transport non-goals, and the rule that the initial interop seam is narrower than the full framework API
And the inventory explicitly includes the thread, branch, turn, and run lifecycle operations needed to preserve the current runtime surface over a remote kernel path
And the inventory explicitly excludes framework-owned ExecutionHandle controls such as cancel, steer, and approval resolution from the kernel transport
```

**KRT-T002 Proto and Buf Governance**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-T001
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2`, `5`; TechSpec `4.9`, `5.2`
- **Description:** Add kernel `.proto` ownership plus root Buf v2 configuration so the first transport surface has lint, generation, and breaking-change governance from the start without widening into framework handle controls.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the kernel interop surface has been inventoried
When proto and Buf governance is added
Then the repository contains boundary-owned kernel `.proto` files plus root Buf configuration
And transport changes are gated by lint and breaking-change checks rather than ad hoc review alone
And Buf `FILE` compatibility is the default breaking gate from the first `.proto` merge onward
```

**KRT-T003 Interop-Smoke Target Wiring and Binding Placement**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-R003, KRT-T002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2.1`, `4.5`; TechSpec `4.9`, `5.1.1`, `5.2`
- **Description:** Wire `codegen` and `interop-smoke` targets plus generated-binding placement rules so transport support code stays with the consuming implementation tree and the repo can exercise real cross-process checks later.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the kernel `.proto` surface is Buf-governed
When interop-smoke target wiring is complete
Then generated bindings live under the consuming implementation tree
And the repo exposes `codegen` and `interop-smoke` targets that invoke the native generators and smoke paths for the active ecosystems
```

### Epic U - Rust Kernel Baseline (RKB)

- Closed in current repo reality through `constitution/spikes/epic-u-rust-kernel-baseline-inventory.md`. This epic introduced Rust only under the kernel boundary and only after the artifact-backed seam existed.

**KRT-U001 Cargo Workspace and Rust Toolchain Integration**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 3
- **Dependencies:** KRT-T002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `2`, `5`; TechSpec `1`, `5.1`, `5.2`
- **Description:** Introduce the root Cargo workspace and Rust toolchain files plus repo wrappers so Rust tasks join the monorepo without redefining boundary ownership or replacing Nx orchestration.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the kernel transport surface is governed
When Rust workspace integration is added
Then the repository contains the root Cargo workspace and toolchain files
And repo orchestration can invoke Rust-native build and test flows without redefining the boundary-owned layout
```

**KRT-U002 Rust Kernel Core Scaffold**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Dependencies:** KRT-R004, KRT-S003, KRT-U001
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-001`, `CAP-P0-005`, `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`; TechSpec `3.1`, `3.6`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Implement the first Rust kernel core scaffold against the shared protocol profile, deterministic identity rules, and kernel-visible operations without widening semantics or transport scope.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the Rust workspace exists and kernel grammar is authored
When the Rust kernel core scaffold is complete
Then Rust implements the required protocol record and validation baselines for the first conformance phase
And the Rust kernel does not widen the shared semantics or depend on framework-specific shortcuts
And Rust implementation work consumes the preexisting telemetry semantic-convention source instead of inventing a second observability vocabulary
```

**KRT-U003 Rust Conformance Runner**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Dependencies:** KRT-S004, KRT-U002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-005`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `4.5`; TechSpec `3.6`, `5.2`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Add a Rust conformance runner that consumes the shared boundary-owned protocol and recovery suites using the same suite naming and reporting discipline as TypeScript.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the Rust kernel core and shared conformance assets exist
When the Rust conformance runner is added
Then the protocol and recovery suites run against Rust through the shared suite contract
And the reported results are comparable with the TypeScript runner outputs without bespoke interpretation
```

**KRT-U004 Rust gRPC Kernel Service**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Dependencies:** KRT-T002, KRT-U002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`; TechSpec `4.9`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Expose the Rust kernel over the governed transport contract as the first real cross-process runtime seam.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the Rust kernel core and governed transport surface exist
When the Rust gRPC kernel service is implemented
Then the kernel operations and stable event and error payloads are available over the defined process boundary
And the service remains limited to the kernel scope rather than reimplementing the framework surface
```

### Epic V - TypeScript Framework and Rust Kernel Interop Stabilization (TRI)

- Closed in current repo reality through `constitution/spikes/epic-v-transport-decision-inventory.md` and `constitution/spikes/epic-v-framework-rust-kernel-interop-closure-inventory.md`. This epic proved the boring day-two TS-framework-to-Rust-kernel path; Epic W now uses that evidence as input to mature the semantic ecosystem before any additional implementation line starts.

**KRT-V001 TypeScript Transport Client and Runtime Switch**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-U004
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-019`, `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `2.1`, `4.5`; TechSpec `4.1`, `4.9`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Add the TypeScript-side transport client and explicit runtime selection seam so the framework can target either the in-process TypeScript kernel or the Rust kernel service without changing host-facing semantics.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the Rust kernel service exists
When the TypeScript transport client and runtime switch are added
Then the framework can target either the local TypeScript kernel or the Rust kernel through an explicit seam
And host-facing runtime behavior stays aligned with the existing public contracts
```

**KRT-V002 Cross-Language Interop and Compatibility Matrix**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-U003, KRT-V001
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `4.5`; TechSpec `4.10`, `5.2`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Run real TS framework to Rust kernel scenarios and generate the compatibility matrix from the resulting conformance and interop-smoke evidence as a conservative near-public readiness signal.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the Rust kernel passes its conformance runner and the TypeScript framework can target the transport seam
When cross-language interop scenarios run
Then named TS framework to Rust kernel smoke suites pass or fail explicitly
And the repository generates a compatibility matrix that records implementation ids, suite ids, suite versions, statuses, and evidence paths from those measured results
And the resulting report is worded conservatively enough to function as a near-public readiness signal rather than an internal-only scratch artifact
```

**KRT-V003 Telemetry Conventions and CI Lane Separation**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-R004, KRT-V002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `5`; TechSpec `3.6`, `4.10`, `5.2`
- **Description:** Apply the shared telemetry vocabulary across TypeScript and Rust interop paths and separate CI into repo-global, language-native, and cross-language validation lanes.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given cross-language interop scenarios now exist
When telemetry conventions and CI lane separation are implemented
Then TypeScript and Rust interop traces and reports use the shared runtime attribute vocabulary
And both implementation lines consume helpers or constants derived from the preexisting telemetry semantic-convention source
And CI clearly separates repo-global checks, language-native checks, and cross-language parity checks
```

**KRT-V004 Interop Closure Inventory**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 2
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-V003
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `5`, `6`; TechSpec `4.10`, `5.3`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Record parity status, residual gaps, and the readiness gate for future semantic maturity work in a closure inventory and update the planning artifacts for the next revision.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the TS framework to Rust kernel seam has conformance, interop, telemetry, and compatibility evidence
When the interop closure inventory is recorded
Then the repository documents measured parity status, remaining gaps, semantic maturity prerequisites, and the TechSpec and Tasks status updates for the next planning pass
```

### Epic W - Semantic Ecosystem Maturity (SEM)

- Closed in current repo reality through `constitution/spikes/epic-w-semantic-coverage-matrix.md` and `constitution/spikes/epic-w-semantic-ecosystem-maturity-closure-inventory.md`.
- Epic W is not Rust framework work. Rust framework start, future concrete drivers, new official backends, provider expansion, host protocol expansion, and future language lines remain deferred unless a later TechSpec revision activates them from Epic W evidence.

**KRT-W001 Semantic Coverage Matrix and Gap Inventory**

- **Type:** Spike
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-V004
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`, `5`; TechSpec `2 ADR-021`, `3.6`, `4.8`, `5.4`
- **Description:** Inventory the semantic coverage gap between `docs/`, TypeScript implementation tests, boundary-owned conformance suites, implementation runners, and compatibility evidence.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given Epics A through V are closed in current repo reality
When the semantic coverage matrix is created
Then each high-value kernel, framework, driver, provider, stream, backend, and error semantic area is mapped to its human spec section, current implementation tests, boundary-owned conformance coverage, compatibility evidence, and gap status
And every gap is classified as promote-to-conformance, implementation-specific, deferred-with-rationale, obsolete, or requiring upstream clarification
And no future implementation line is treated as authorized by object existence or smoke success alone
```

**KRT-W002 Assertion-Bearing Conformance Suite Contract**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-W001
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `4.5`, `5`; TechSpec `3.6`, `4.8`, `4.10`
- **Description:** Mature conformance suite manifests so they name semantic checks, required assertions, runner applicability, evidence fields, and suite-version policy instead of only listing fixture files.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the coverage matrix identifies semantics that must be shared across implementations
When the conformance suite contract is updated
Then boundary-owned suite manifests can declare named semantic checks, fixtures or scenarios, required assertions, implementation applicability, and expected evidence fields
And compatibility reporting can distinguish a check-level pass from a command-level smoke success
And existing TypeScript and Rust conformance runners remain compatible or are migrated in the same change
```

**KRT-W003 Kernel Semantic Conformance Promotion**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-W002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-001`, `CAP-P0-004`, `CAP-P0-005`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2`, `4.5`; TechSpec `3.1`, `3.2`, `3.6`, `4.8`
- **Description:** Promote kernel lifecycle, lineage, recovery, stable error, invalid transition, staged-result, and branch-head semantics from implementation-local tests into boundary-owned kernel conformance suites with TypeScript and Rust runner evidence where applicable.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given kernel semantics are currently split between boundary fixtures and implementation-local tests
When kernel semantic conformance promotion is complete
Then the kernel boundary owns assertion-bearing suites for durable identity, lifecycle transitions, lineage validation, recovery state, branch-head movement, staged-result invariants, and stable error codes
And TypeScript and Rust kernel runners publish comparable evidence for every applicable kernel check
And any kernel behavior not promoted is explicitly classified in the semantic coverage matrix
```

**KRT-W004 Framework and Driver Semantic Conformance Promotion**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-W002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-019`, `CAP-P0-020`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2.1`, `4.5`; TechSpec `4.1`, `4.2`, `4.3`, `4.8`
- **Description:** Promote framework and initial ReAct-driver semantics for turn lifecycle, stream reconciliation, approval pause/resume/reject/cancel, steering, branching, manifests, hook outcomes, tool execution ordering, and stable runtime errors into boundary-owned conformance suites.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the TypeScript runtime-core tests currently carry rich framework and driver semantics
When framework and driver semantic conformance promotion is complete
Then boundary-owned suites assert the shared semantics required for future framework or driver implementations
And TypeScript runtime evidence proves those suites against the existing implementation without making runtime-core the semantic oracle
And ReAct-specific checks are separated from driver-neutral framework checks
```

**KRT-W005 Provider and Stream Semantic Conformance Promotion**

- **Type:** Feature
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-W002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P0-020`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `2.1`, `4.5`, `5`; TechSpec `4.5`, `4.6`, `4.7`, `4.8`
- **Description:** Promote provider bridge, provider contract, canonical stream, SSE, AG-UI, metadata continuity, structured output, tool continuation, and provider-failure semantics into boundary-owned provider/framework conformance where those semantics are not implementation-specific.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given provider and stream semantics are currently split across contract tests, playground tests, and adapter tests
When provider and stream semantic conformance promotion is complete
Then boundary-owned suites assert the provider-neutral prompt, response, stream chunk, tool, structured output, metadata, error, and adapter projection semantics required by future implementations
And provider-family-specific or host-specific behavior remains documented as implementation-specific or local validation
And compatibility evidence records the promoted provider and stream checks separately from playground-only smoke coverage
```

**KRT-W006 Compatibility Evidence Hardening and Closure Inventory**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 2
- **Status:** Closed in current repo reality.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-W003, KRT-W004, KRT-W005
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`, `CAP-P1-036`; Architecture `5`, `6`; TechSpec `4.10`, `5.3`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Harden compatibility evidence so suite results cite named checks and record the remaining gates for future implementation-line activation.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the promoted conformance suites now emit assertion-level evidence
When compatibility evidence hardening is complete
Then the compatibility matrix records suite ids, versions, implementation ids, check summaries, statuses, and evidence paths from measured runs
And the Epic W closure inventory records which semantic surfaces are mature, which remain deferred, and what a later TechSpec must cite before authorizing Rust framework or other new implementation work
And no public or planning claim implies that a new implementation can start without satisfying the named semantic maturity gates
```

### Epic X - TypeScript Topology Normalization (TTN)

- Active in current repo reality. Planning artifact: `constitution/spikes/epic-x-typescript-topology-normalization-plan.md`.
- Goal: relocate every TypeScript-only asset out of the language-neutral slots in `boundaries/` so the path topology reveals language ownership without opening files. No semantic changes, no public API renames, no new neutral specs.
- Out of scope: authoring TypeSpec or CDDL for surfaces that lack a neutral source today (`runtime-api`, `driver-api`, `event-stream`, `core-types`); renaming TypeScript packages; moving Rust crates; changing fixtures, suites, or generated artifacts.

**KRT-X001 Topology Inventory**

- **Type:** Spike
- **Effort:** 1
- **Status:** Pending.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-W006
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `1.4`, `6`; TechSpec `1.1.2`, `5.1`
- **Description:** Confirm the directory list, package list, Nx project list, and consumer list named in the Epic X plan against live repo state, and freeze them as inputs to the relocation tickets.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the Epic X plan exists
When the topology inventory is recorded
Then every TypeScript-only directory under a language-neutral boundary slot is enumerated
And every consumer of an impacted package is enumerated
And the inventory is committed alongside the plan as a frozen input to the relocation tickets
```

**KRT-X002 Testkit Relocation**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 3
- **Status:** Pending.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-X001
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `1.4`, `2`, `6`; TechSpec `1.1.2`, `5.1`
- **Description:** Move the kernel, framework, and provider testkit packages out of `boundaries/<area>/testkit/` into `boundaries/<area>/implementations/typescript/testkit/`, update Nx project metadata, regenerate workspace symlinks, and verify all consumer build/typecheck/test/conformance lanes still pass.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the testkit packages currently live at boundary-root testkit slots
When KRT-X002 is complete
Then each testkit package directory lives under boundaries/<area>/implementations/typescript/testkit/
And no testkit consumer requires a package.json edit because of the move
And bun run typecheck, bun run conformance, and per-package nx test targets pass for every consumer
And no fixture, suite manifest, or public package API has been modified
```

**KRT-X003 Contract Implementation Relocation**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 5
- **Status:** Pending.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-X002
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `1.4`, `2`, `6`; TechSpec `1.1.2`, `5.1`
- **Description:** Move the TypeScript package guts of every contract package (`kernel-protocol`, `runtime-api`, `driver-api`, `event-stream`, `tool-contracts`, `provider-api`, `core-types`) into a sibling `implementations/typescript/` directory while leaving language-neutral `spec/`, `artifacts/`, and README assets at the contract root. Update Nx project metadata and verify all build/typecheck/test/conformance lanes.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given the contract directories currently mix language-neutral spec assets with TypeScript package guts
When KRT-X003 is complete
Then each contract directory exposes only language-neutral assets at its root and houses TypeScript implementation files under implementations/typescript/
And no consumer package.json requires editing because of the move
And bun run typecheck, bun run conformance, bun run codegen, and per-package nx test targets pass without regression
And no public package API, fixture, suite manifest, or generated artifact has been modified beyond path updates
```

**KRT-X004 Topology Guardrail Documentation**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 2
- **Status:** Pending.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-X003
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `1.4`, `6`; TechSpec `1.1.2`, `5.1`
- **Description:** Codify the path-topology rule so the gaps cannot re-emerge. Update `AGENTS.md` boundary-discipline guidance, add a TechSpec ADR pinning the rule, and update Architecture.md `6` to mark the cross-language drift mitigation as enforced through Epic X.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given KRT-X002 and KRT-X003 have moved every TS-only asset into implementations/typescript/
When the topology guardrail documentation is complete
Then AGENTS.md states the path-topology rule explicitly enough that a reviewer can reject misplaced TS-only files
And the TechSpec carries an ADR that names the rule, its rationale, and the deferred Gap C surfaces
And Architecture.md section 6 notes that the cross-language drift mitigation is enforced through Epic X
```

**KRT-X005 Epic X Closure Inventory**

- **Type:** Chore
- **Effort:** 1
- **Status:** Pending.
- **Dependencies:** KRT-X004
- **Capability / Contract Mapping:** PRD `CAP-P1-035`; Architecture `6`; TechSpec `1.1.2`, `5.1`, `5.4.1`
- **Description:** Record what Epic X delivered, which gaps it closed, which it deliberately deferred, and the planning-doc status updates needed for the next epic.
- **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Given KRT-X001 through KRT-X004 are complete
When the Epic X closure inventory is recorded
Then the closure file lists relocated packages, updated Nx project paths, the topology rule's authority location, and the deferred Gap C surfaces with their rationale
And TechSpec.md and Tasks.md status language is updated to mark Epic X closed in current repo reality
```
