# Epic AD TypeScript Freeze Gate Report

## Decision

TypeScript is not yet a freeze-closure candidate at the end of Epic AD alone. Epic AD establishes the docs-to-authority classification gate. TypeScript freeze closure still requires Epic AE modular hardening, Epic AF conformance expansion and freshness guardrails, and fresh clean-checkout evidence.

Rust framework product work remains blocked until Epic AF closes and a later TechSpec/Tasks revision explicitly activates a product implementation line.

## Authority-Backed and Conformance-Covered Claims

- Independent claims currently classified as authority-backed and conformance-covered: 100
- Duplicate matrix rows linked by `duplicateOf`: 3
- Evidence anchors: framework, provider, and kernel authority packets; shared conformance plans; boundary fixtures/scenarios; adapter capabilities; and compatibility evidence under `reports/compatibility/evidence/`.

## Remaining Surfaces

- Potentially blocking until AE/AF or docs correction evidence closes: 96
- Non-blocking because they are explicitly implementation-defined or deferred: 27

## Remaining Surface Detail

Every remaining non-authority surface is listed below with its current blocker posture. `missing-conformance-follow-up` rows are blocking until AF either promotes checks or explicitly leaves the behavior local/deferred.

## Exact Evidence Required for Freeze Closure

- `KRT-AE009` must show the TypeScript semantic gravity wells have been decomposed without public API churn.
- `KRT-AF001` must convert every `missing-conformance-follow-up` claim selected for portability into packet/plan/fixture/adapter/evidence work.
- `KRT-AF002` through `KRT-AF006` must add the selected shared checks and keep local/deferred behavior out of portable authority.
- `KRT-AF007` must wire guardrails so docs normative drift fails validation unless the matrix is updated.
- `KRT-AF008` must regenerate clean evidence through `bun run verify`, `bun run release-check`, `bun run conformance`, `bun run codegen`, and `bun run interop-smoke`.
- `reports/compatibility/compatibility-matrix.json` must report the final check-level evidence for every affected implementation.

## Blocker Statement

No future framework implementation line, including Rust framework product behavior, is unblocked by Epic AD alone. The earliest unblock point is after Epic AF and AE close, with a later planning revision naming the next implementation line.
