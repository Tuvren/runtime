// Fast inner-loop lane. Sits between `verify:kernel` (focused kernel boundary)
// and `verify` (full release gate): it always runs the cheap authority gate so
// the inner loop can never drift from the constitution, then uses Nx `affected`
// to typecheck/test/lint only the projects touched by the working tree. Rust is
// graph-coarse under Nx (the cargo wrappers carry no source-level edges), so a
// workspace-wide cargo gate runs only when Rust sources actually changed.

// The constitutional gate for the inner loop: the cheap, read-only authority
// and conformance validators, always run regardless of which files changed —
// drift here is cheap to detect and expensive to discover late. We select these
// by ID from verify's shared AUTHORITY_GATE_STEPS rather than re-declaring the
// commands, so the inner loop cannot silently diverge from `verify`'s gate: if
// one of these IDs stops matching a verify step, buildInnerLoopAuthorityGate
// throws instead of quietly dropping that check.
//
// `machine authority guardrails` is intentionally omitted: it runs ~4s (vs
// <500ms for every other gate step) which is too slow for the inner loop, and
// it is still enforced by `verify` / `verify:kernel`. Every other authority
// validator is cheap enough to keep here.
