# Idempotent session bootstrap for devenv-managed services (PostgreSQL, ...).
#
# `devenv up -d` is NOT idempotent: a second invocation exits non-zero with
# "Processes already running". That makes the documented "run once at session
# start" step a footgun when a developer re-runs it. This wrapper swallows the
# already-running case so the command is safe to call repeatedly.
#
# This is a manual, top-level convenience only. Do NOT embed it inside Nx
# targets, conformance runners, or the verify lanes — those still assume the
# caller has already started services once, per the repository guidelines.

# Idempotency hinges on devenv's human-readable "already running" message. That
# string is an upstream UX detail that could be reworded across devenv versions;
# `devenv.lock` pins the version, so the phrasing is stable for this repo. If a
# future devenv bump changes the wording, this branch stops matching and re-runs
# revert to a hard failure (the footgun this wrapper removes) — update the regex
# alongside the lock bump if that happens.
