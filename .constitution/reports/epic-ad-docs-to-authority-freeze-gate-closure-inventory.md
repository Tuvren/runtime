# Epic AD Docs-to-Authority Freeze Gate Closure Inventory

## Status

Epic AD is closed in current repo reality.

## Delivered Scope

- The active freeze-readiness scope was already activated in `.constitution/tasks/` and `.constitution/tech-spec/` before this closure pass.
- The normative docs claim inventory covers 265 matrix rows and 262 independent claims from `docs/KrakenFrameworkSpecification.md` and `docs/KrakenKernelSpecification.md`.
- The docs-to-authority coverage matrix assigns exactly one primary classification to every row and links duplicate rows through `duplicateOf` instead of treating them as separate independent requirements.
- Framework deferred-surface decisions and kernel/backend/provider local-surface decisions are checked in as Epic AD handoff records.
- Docs preambles now distinguish human semantic authority from machine portability authority and point readers to the AD matrix for freeze-readiness classification.
- The freeze gate report records that TypeScript is not freeze-ready from AD alone and that Rust framework remains blocked until AE/AF and a later planning revision close the gate.

## Closure Notes

- TypeScript implementation source, implementation tests, conformance adapters, generic runner code, and Markdown prose remain forbidden authority for cross-implementation meaning.
- Epic AF owns promotion of any remaining portable behavior into packet-backed shared conformance.
- Epic AE owns TypeScript modular hardening. Epic AD did not change runtime behavior.
