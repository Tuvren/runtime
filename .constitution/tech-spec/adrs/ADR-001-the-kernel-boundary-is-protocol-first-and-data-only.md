### ADR-001 The Kernel Boundary Is Protocol-First and Data-Only

- **Status:** accepted
- **Context:** The frozen kernel specification explicitly defines the kernel-framework boundary as a protocol where everything crossing the boundary is serializable data. Future multi-language SDKs and future non-TypeScript kernel implementations depend on preserving this narrow waist.
- **Decision:** The authoritative kernel boundary is a language-neutral protocol of concrete data structures and operations. No callbacks, framework types, or runtime-specific object identities cross the boundary.
- **Consequences:** The TechSpec must define exact record shapes, byte encoding, hashing, and operation signatures. TypeScript APIs above the kernel are framework SDK surfaces, not substitutes for the kernel protocol.
