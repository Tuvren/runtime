### ADR-006 Official Backends Use One Strict Uniform Kernel Contract

- **Status:** accepted
- **Context:** Tuvren Runtime is a framework product, not a storage product. Developers must be able to move between backends without kernel-semantic drift.
- **Decision:** All official backends implement one strict kernel contract. Optional backend capabilities are not exposed at the kernel layer in v0.1.
- **Consequences:** Shared backend conformance suites remain authoritative. Backend-specific performance tricks stay internal. The framework and future SDKs do not branch on backend feature flags.
