 * exactly one ExecutionClass and terminates at one of the terminal states.
 *
 * States:
 * - resolved:        capability binding was resolved from the tool name.
 * - policy-admitted: invocation-time policy granted admission.
 * - dispatched:      invocation was sent to the execution-class endpoint
 *                    (observable: tool.start event emitted).
 * - completed:       terminal — execution completed successfully
 *                    (observable: tool.result with isError: false or absent).
 * - failed:          terminal — execution failed or was policy-denied
 *                    (observable: tool.result with isError: true).
 * - ignored:         terminal — a result arrived after the invocation was
 *                    cancelled or a hard-stop bound was exceeded; the result
 *                    is discarded without mutating durable state and no
 *                    tool.result event is emitted. Reserved for the bounds
 *                    guard (KRT-BD006); no observable event anchor exists
 *                    until that guard is implemented. Not to be confused with
 *                    the tuvren-client stale-lease path which surfaces as
 *                    `failed` (tool.result isError:true, CAPABILITY_RESULT_STALE).
